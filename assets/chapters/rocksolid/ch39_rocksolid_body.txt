Chapter Thirty-NineArchall Diamond had it all worked out. There was a tide that turned at midnight and he’d decided the dentist was going to be on it. It was risky because people were still out at that time along the river fishing and fucking in their cars, so he’d have to pick his moment. Also, there was the issue with this Chendrill—the ape who drove the Aston.    What he thought he’d do is get the truck loaded with what he needed beforehand and attach a small winch, then he’d put two wooden planks in so he could drag the fucker up if the dentist was too heavy. Getting him on his own was going to be the hard part. The last thing he needed to do was Taser him in the backroom surgery of the basement suite and take a chance that Alla was going to find out and have it cause problems in the relationship, which he knew it could. This is why he’d given up that idea. What he needed to do was be slick and shrewd, which he knew he was—after all, he’d done the birdman and got away with it. But if it got out he’d done the dentist, then people would be putting two and two together and he’d be getting a rep with the ladies he didn’t need, especially if things didn’t work out with Alla, which happens—he knew that.    There was a lot to think about. The caveman days of bashing a love rival over the head with a rock were long past. Man had evolved and the consequences involving a woman’s feelings needed to be taken into consideration—he was, after all, a ladies’ man.******Rann Singh walked around his new ranch home that was once his grandfather’s for what seemed now the hundredth time. But now he’d gotten off his ass and found the money to buy it back; only no one was coming and he was alone. All the work he’d done, all the nights of following those sad fuckers around the East Side, helping them convert their ways to the good—all via cash transactions—was worthless. Yes, he had the ranch with the view he was already bored of, yes, he had the African village and the fields that stretched out to the forest, but he didn’t have his granddaddy to come and enjoy it with him, and he was bitter.    Yes, he’d been around the village talking to his workers he’d be paying a pittance to, and he’d played with their children as they hung on his arms and legs as he walked through smiling and enjoying them, but it couldn’t break the heartache. He walked back out to the deck, kicking out at nothing, and stared at the mountains, looking at his Land Rover, considering taking another trip into town to see the estate agent with his limp wristed handshake to ask him when he’d be delivering his zebra like he’d promised. He’d been their twice earlier, thrashing the Land Rover through the gears and thinking it was going to roll on the corners, telling Joseph he couldn’t come because it was going to get nasty.    Standing there outside the agent’s window and spitting on the ground, waiting for him to come in even though it was a Sunday. Wondering where he lived and leaving heavy messages on the guy’s answering service in English and Swahili. He’d promised it and he could take it out that fucking fat commission he’d earned off the South African asshole who’d called him a Choot and given him a shotgun but no cartridges to go with it.    But the South African was another issue—the first was the zebra, and he wanted it.   He walked back into the ranch and into the main bedroom. It was a huge room with log walls and a king size bed in the center. Overhead, a fan wafted the mosquito net he’d so often dreamed of sleeping under, dreaming of laying with the windows open listening to the night and feeling the breeze coming off the mountain on his face until he slept, dreaming of waking to the call of morning birds as dawn broke. But not now. He looked under the bed and saw Joseph hiding there, sleeping, just as his grandfather told him he would often do, but even this wasn’t funny now. He kicked the bed, waking Joseph, and followed him back out onto the deck as he scurried off, disappearing out the back.   He stood there for the longest time, thinking about it all without moving anything except his tongue and lips as he spat, not caring anymore if his phlegm hit the wooden deck or the whitewashed rocks of the garden below. The lawyer with the big mouth would be getting a visit soon. He’d tell him, he’s going to die—that’s what happens here in Africa, or whatever the prick had said, standing there with his briefcase and soft suede beige desert boots like these Brit colonials all like to wear, like they were the fucking elite. Yeah, he’d get a fucking visit too, he’d tell him to cough in for the zebra and to stop being a fucking prick mouth piece.    Soon it was dark, the birds going to bed, the village children not long after, some fires still burning, lighting up the side of the huts as the women finished cooking. Rann’s dinner was still on the table, half eaten where Joseph had left it along with the Tusker beer that was long drank. It would be sorted tomorrow, he thought, by this time tomorrow it would be done. He’d be up early with the birds in the morning and head straight into town to catch the estate agent before he’d put the key in the lock of the front door, and whisper in his ear that he had till the end of the week to get a zebra on his lawn as promised—and it had better be a young one, he didn’t want something on its last legs that couldn’t outrun the kids, or he’d be coming back to stick the Land Rover through the shop window.    Then he’d see the lawyer, and tell him what he thought of his boots and his smart mouth. But the real issue was that South African cunt who’d been stupid enough to call him a Choot and leave his forwarding address in the living room. Bad move, you fucking Nazi fuck. Rann was coming after him right after he’d been to see the lawyer. He’d better have the engine running on that plane, Rann thought, because it was going to be a long old ride to the coast; and by the time Rann was there, he wasn’t going to be in a good mood whilst he’d be standing on the doorstep of his waterfront mansion in Mombasa asking that fuck to repeat the exact words he’d said to him as he’d left the house the day before. He’d see if the man had the guts to do it, to look him in the eye and call the guy who’d just given him $200,001 cash for his house a Choot.    And that’s exactly what he was going to do.     He didn’t know how long he’d been standing out there in the darkness staring into nothing, oblivious to the mosquitos and the sounds of the village as it finally settled, the fires dying, their warmth and golden light fading as just the ambers glowed.   He went into the bedroom’s en suite bathroom and got ready for bed. He took a shower and tried to calm down. The water was still warm from the fire Joseph lit just before dusk under the forty-five-gallon drum that contained water out back. He finished and dried himself with a towel so old he wondered if it went back all the way to his grandfather’s time there before that Nazi with the big mouth had cheated the place from him.    Rann walked to the bed and lay down. He looked up at the mosquito net knotted above him hanging from an ornate hook dug into a thick wooden rafter above. He could stand on his tip toes and get it down, stretch it out around the bed, protect himself from the mosquitos hiding in the shadows waiting for him to sleep so they could swoop down and take his blood. But what was the point? What was the point of any of it, being here laying on the bed his grandfather no longer wanted and that had been home to a guy who’d just called him a cunt?    He closed his eyes and listened to the darkness as the crickets sang their night song. The breeze gently blew the leaves in the trees. Tomorrow, he thought, tomorrow he’d sort out these people who had mocked him, reneging on a deal that was nothing to them but everything to him. He thought of that guy with the plane, laying there five hundred miles away on a mattress loaded with money. Tomorrow, tomorrow he’d extinguish the rage that roared within him. If he was lucky, the bodyguard would be there with the South African, and he would get tough and come at him, so Rann could show him how to fight.     And closing his eyes, he listened to the night, breathing the mountain air that swept through the forest and across the fields that he owned deep into his lungs. He let it out slowly, over and over, just as his Sensei had taught him during his training days, until his body had unconsciously taken over—breathing until he relaxed, allowing him control enough to permit sleep, despite the rage that surged within. But when sleep eventually did come, it was a sleep fitful and turbulent, filled with angry dreams of conflict that shook him into semi-consciousness hour by hour until at last, at four a.m., he awoke from a dream in which the world was shaking and opened his eyes to find five Africans who’d come in off the mountains holding pangar machetes in their hands standing there around his bed in the darkness.    Rann Singh’s Sikh god Guru Nanak was looking out for him. ******Charles Chuck Chendrill stopped the Aston outside of the house in Burnaby with its basement suite where he’d first met the dentist named Dennis who’d lost his licence because he’d married a woman who was a whore and she’d destroyed him. The last time they’d spoken, things were good again between them, and there had been talk of a new future in the remote Northern Territories, where some of the inhabitants wanted to keep hold of their remaining teeth. “It would pay well,” he’d said to Chendrill, and Chendrill had felt happy for him.    Closing the door quietly, he walked down the driveway and knocked on the suite’s side entrance and waited, the lights on but no TV. Stepping back, he stood in the darkness watching the light on the curtains, the basement suite apartment appearing still within. Then he saw movement, someone at the window, then another, a figure coming from the back room moving towards the window that looked out towards the front road. The curtain moved slightly and then the figure crossed, casting a huge shadow through the front door as it opened. Chendrill stepped forward out of the shadow, “Dennis, who are you hiding from?”   But he wasn’t hiding from anyone—the idiot who was sniffing around his wife was already sitting inside.    Archall Diamond sat in the living room with a pair of Ray-Bans on as though any second the sun may come out, even though it was night-time. The ‘gangsta’ sitting there gawking at Alla while Dennis messed about in his bullshit surgery. Moments before he’d just been about to lean in and ask her to leave her husband for him so he wouldn’t have to kill him, giving her the option before things went too far, when he’d heard the door and felt irritated at the interruption, sneaking a look and shitting his pants when he saw it was Chendrill’s Aston Martin.    Seeing Chendrill, Dennis smiled. “Chuck, just the man I wanted to see. How are you?”    Dennis let him in and Chendrill looked at Archall as though he knew he was there all along.    “I was about to call you about a problem that is developing,” said Dennis.   And he had been, the gangster guy with the stupid tooth was becoming a pest. Chendrill smiled at Alla and sat himself down at the kitchen table where he always sat, guessing Archall Diamond was the problem. “Well I’m here now, what’s up?” Dennis just stood there, not knowing what to say.   Already knowing the answer from putting two and two together, Chendrill asked, loud enough for everyone to hear, if it was Dennis who’d fixed Diamond’s front tooth.    “Yes, it looks really good.”    Chendrill looked at Dennis, unsurprised that the man was doing backstreet work now that he had his mind in gear and imagined he had a set up out back. Looking past him, he saw Alla, who still managed to look gorgeous, despite living through her own hell. Archall sat opposite her in his sunglasses, mesmerized by the beautiful woman sitting politely with a blanket across her lap. Archall and Patrick are the same, though, Chendrill thought—both men were transfixed by the woman and neither was half the man her husband was.    He said quietly, “How’s Alla doing?”    Dennis smiled. It wasn’t often anyone asked him about his wife, not these days.    “She’s getting better I think. She’s managing to move her toes. Apparently, we were lucky—the guy who worked on her that night was a top surgeon. She’s been to see him and had x-rays done. The man’s saying a couple more operations and things may improve tenfold. He’s even suggesting she may be able to walk again.”     Chendrill said, “But?”    And Dennis nodded, “Yeah, you’re right, there’s always a ‘but’, and it’s a big one, it’s going to cost money to do it now or we can wait and let it go through the healthcare system. But there’s another problem there, which I’m ashamed to say is mine, because, you see, when I lost everything, I let the healthcare insurance slip too. Luckily someone—and I don’t even want to think about who—but someone luckily put up the money for the accident, and I’m hoping whoever did was from the past and stays there.”   Chendrill stared at him, then down at the table cloth, and thought about Patrick, knowing deep down it was him—the guy living his life without any real responsibility, treating hookers the same way others would treat a girl with whom they were in a serious relationship. Looking up again, he said, “Many ‘buts’ hey?”    Dennis nodded again, “Yeah too many.”   Chendrill sat there staring at Archall Diamond, wondering why the guy was sitting in their living room at eight-thirty in the evening wearing sunglasses. What he’d do, he thought, was speak to Sebastian about Alla and see if he could help and then have Sebastian tell Patrick to lay off and stay away. After all, Sebastian was the only person the sexed-up ex-condo salesman would listen to, for the moment anyhow. “How much for the operation if you go private?” said Chendrill.   “About a hundred grand for them both,” Dennis answered.    Then Chendrill nodded towards Archall Diamond, “And can I ask you why that asshole is here?”    And from Dennis’s face, he could see the man was a pain. Coming straight out with it, Dennis said, “I haven’t got my licence back yet—as you’ve probably guessed—and one of the problems with operating outside the system is that first of all, you may not get paid and second of all, some of the people aren’t nice, but they do pay, and pay well. And Archall pays well. He just got here actually and has told me about a friend of his who also wants a diamond in his tooth. Apparently, he liked Archall’s so much he’d like me to go see him out in Richmond—at some house on the river.”   Chendrill said, “I don’t recommend you go anywhere with him,” and watched Dennis shrug.    “Obviously I need the money Chuck, it’s not what I’d prefer to do, but I can’t afford to turn anything down right now, even if it costs me my licence for good, which to be frank I may never get back anyway.”   Chendrill nodded. The man was so honest with his friends, but not with himself. Or maybe he was? At least he was trying to make it work again with the woman he loved when so many would have given up. Chendrill said, “When you go, call me. I want to come along with you—I’m serious. If this guy gives you a problem about it, you call me okay. Do not go alone.”    Chendrill stood. “I can’t promise anything, I’m going to speak with someone about Alla and—he may be able to help financially.”    Then changing the subject, Chendrill called out loudly to Alla, “Alla, I’m glad to see you’re looking well.” Then nodding towards Archall Diamond, he followed it up jokingly with, “And keep away from him, he’s trouble.”    Then he turned and said quietly to Dennis, “Don’t forget what I said.”    Chendrill left the basement, but not before crossing the open suite to hug Alla and kiss her cheek, smelling her perfect skin and getting a closer look at Diamond as he tried to read what the guy was up to.   He pulled the Aston away from the curb and drove up the street, then went around the block and stopped in the shadows a distance away, looking at the lights in the windows of the basement suite that now doubled as Dennis’ surgery. Archall Diamond was sitting in his friend’s home, he thought, more interested in some friend’s tooth than in his Mercedes, which for some reason was sitting crushed to a cube in the garage.    “A friend of his also wants a diamond in his tooth,” Dennis had said.   Guys like Diamond don’t arrange for other people to fuck up their perfectly good front teeth like that, thought Chendrill, they want to be unique—even if they were as dumb as that fuckhead. There was more to it. The guy had removed one love rival, of that much he was certain, but there was nothing going on between those two. From what Chendrill could tell, all Archall Diamond was doing was gawking at a beautiful woman who was being polite.    An hour later, Chendrill was still there watching the front of Dennis’s when he saw Diamond come out, still with his sunglasses on, even though it was night-time, smiling to himself and, stopping in the driveway for a moment, he stared at the windows, then walked to the rear of a truck and opened it.    Quietly, Chendrill opened the Aston’s driver side door, slipped out, closed it again, and moved in the shadows along the other side of the street towards where Diamond was standing with the back of the truck down and both hands in a tool bag sifting through it until he pulled out a pair of long nose pliers.    Coming up from behind at an angle and catching him on his blind side, Chendrill said, “You going back in there with those to help him pull some teeth?” Archall turned, quickly pulling the Taser from his bag and firing the unit’s two small darts with their thin wires trailing behind and catching Chendrill right in the shoulder as he tried to twist away, sending fifty thousand volts into him and throwing him helplessly to the ground. ******Rann Singh sat up in bed and looked to the five Africans surrounding him as they stood, pangars in hand, with ragged clothes and unkempt dreadlocked matted hair and said in Swahili, “I’ll give you about thirty seconds to leave peacefully right now or I’m going to leave you all for dead and if you live you live.”    Rann watched as the one in the center held up Blou’s empty shotgun then threw it on the floor. Rann stared at him summing them all up. He was the biggest, and in the moonlight Rann could see his eyes were watery and yellow, but he looked strong. The others were smaller with the same blotchy bearded look of the same age; another, looking nervous, was younger, just a kid, maybe in his early twenties. Rann said, “The other guy needed that, I don’t.”    And the African replied simply, “Money or we kill you.”   Then Rann smiled and said as he raised his hands, speaking Swahili, the language he loved so much, “Okay, okay. You win—you win. You can have the money. It’s behind the door.” And asking with his eyes if it was okay to move, he slowly slid out of bed, shuffling his way toward the door as the Africans kept their distance, but blocked his path as Rann stood and leaned forward, placing his hands out in front of himself, touching the wood of the beamed wall, and feeling its varnish beneath his palms. He said again, “I’m going to get your money, it’s right here by the door.”    And slowly Rann began to move towards the door along the wall. Passing his grandfather’s coat hook, he saw the small nail he’d watched him hammer in for him when he was a child, remembering how he had stood holding a huge hammer in both hands as his grandfather held the nail and Rann tried to knock it into one of the beams.    He moved on slowly, step by step along the wall until he was out and away from the bed. He reached the door, large and solid and open wide, just as he’d left it before he’d slept, its inner face hidden from view flat against the wooden wall beams. The Africans in the open doorway watched him cautiously as he slowly pulled it away from the wall and gently brought them inside, respecting their superiority with his eyes as he squeezed it past them, feeling the weight of the mahogany bite down tight against the door jam as he closed the solid door and gently turned the key, feeling the bronze of the deadbolt fall into place as he locked them all in the room with him.    Slowly he turned to them, dropping the key into his trouser pocket for them all to see, and said in the language he knew they’d all understand, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”   He brought his right foot up hard and fast, catching the African who’d thrown the shotgun on the floor perfectly in the throat, crushing his windpipe and knocking him into the wall as a younger second man came at him, instinctively hacking down blindly with his pangar. Rann felt the young man’s arm break at the elbow as he stepped to the side, holding the man’s wrist with his left hand and snapping the elbow with his other as he took the man’s knee out with his left foot, all in one swift move, and then let go.   Taking a quick step forward, he smashed the flat of his foot into the third African’s chest, sending him off his feet and into the wall; then ducking, feeling the swish of a pangar blade skimming his head right before feeling the weight of the fifth African as he grabbed him from the side and ran him into the wall. He felt the sting in his back as he landed hard next to his grandfather’s coat hook, and then the other African who’d taken the kick to the chest was on him, holding him fast along with the other, both clinging desperately to their pangars as they pushed against him holding him there. Rann felt their strong hands and arms pressing against him and smelled their breath, sweat, and hair as they tried to tire him with their strength, rubbing their heads and elbows into his face. Then he felt one release the hand he was holding the pangar in as he worked the butt of the weapon into his neck, the man pulling back and swinging in for the kill, Rann waiting till the last second as the blade came down, pulling away from the other, spinning inside and using the man’s momentum to roll him around, smashing him into the wall, crushing the man’s nose with the back of his head and hearing the metal from his grandfather’s coat hook pierce through the man’s skull as he hit the wall. Then like lightning, he was away, coming again back at the other African, moving inside him as the man came at him hitting as hard as he had ever hit another man with an eight punch combo, crashing his fists with incredible speed and precision into the African’s solar plexus, stomach, and heart and hearing the man’s pangar hit the ground as he felt the muscles and ribs break down as his fists flew in and out like whips, one after the other, sending him momentarily to the floor.    Then he backed off, bouncing around the floor at the foot of his grandfather’s bed, like a boxer catching his breath and surveying the damage. One was dead, hanging limp from his grandfather’s hook, another on the floor not breathing from the kick to the throat that crushed his windpipe, the kid down with a broken arm looking terrified, another was moving quickly from the side swinging his pangar like Zorro, hacking and slashing the air from side to side as he came. Rann moved to the corner by the door as he approached, letting the African pin him there, using each wall as a shield, waiting for the angle to change as the man switched the swinging from side to side and tried to throw down a thrust from another angle that he’d hope would be the last, then it came at him like lightning from above, the man raising the pangar and bringing it down with both hands, hoping to smash through Rann’s forearms as he lifted them to protect himself from the blow. As soon as the African committed to the swipe, like a whip, Rann was on him grabbing both the man’s wrists as he twisted himself down to the side, using the man’s momentum to pull him downward and smash him face-first to the floor.    Rann backed off again, bouncing like a fighter, keeping on his toes, getting his air and looking around him, the Africans in shock from what had happened to them in nothing more than a matter of seconds. He looked around feeling air rush in and out of his lungs as he felt his heart race in his chest. No one was coming at him yet. One dead, maybe two by now, as he’d felt the power of his foot hit the man’s throat. Another, the young one unmoving, crouching down with a broken arm and busted knee, was still terrified. The African Zorro was playing dead. The one who’d suffered the punch combo to the stomach and chest was on his hands and knees and now just getting his wind. He’d be next and would be coming at him again.    He waited, knowing he could finish them all, but he waited, breathing, skipping in the center of the room as he regained his strength and kicked any pangars he could see under the bed. Then the African who thought he was Zorro stood and looked at Rann, his face covered in blood, his lip and nose split open; the other African was staring at Rann now too. Rann, who was trained to fight, still keeping on his toes and wiping the sweat from his eyes and his now bald head, only too happy to have no hair for any of them to grab and hold.    The remaining two men looked at each other, then to the kid on the floor who’d given up, motioning with their eyes, signalling him to stand. Rann said in Swahili, “If you think you can just say sorry and leave you can’t. You had your chance.”    But these men who lived in the forest at the foot of the mountain weren’t going anywhere. Slowly the kid with the broken arm got to his feet. Still bobbing, Rann said to him, “Sit back down and stay out of it and I’ll not break the other one and maybe you’ll live.”   But he didn’t listen. Suddenly the one by the door came at him, running full force as the other came at the same time. Rann moved to the side at the last second, lifting his left leg and tripping one, sending him headfirst into the dresser and smashing face first into the mirror as he landed. The other dove on him, pinning Rann to the floor, grabbing him by his neck in a choke hold as he began to shout at the kid with the broken arm.    “Pangar, Pangar.”    The kid moved towards the collection of pangars under the bed, reaching under and picking one up and slowly moving back towards them as the African struggled to hold onto Rann as he wriggled and wriggled, trying to break free. The African shouted at the kid desperately, “Hit him in the head—Hit him in the head.”    As the kid moved forward, trying to hold his broken arm at the same time as the pangar, reaching them at the foot of the bed and looking down at Rann’s head, Rann wriggling like crazy, tasting the man’s blood from his arm, smelling his breath, feeling the African’s face against the side of his head, the man wrapping his legs around him, clasping him with his whole body, still screaming at the kid, “Kill him—Kill him!” The kid drew nearer, trying to summon the courage to slay a man. Then he was right there above them, letting his broken arm dangle as he raised the pangar wiping the tears from his eyes from the fear and pain with the back of his hand. Rann watched as he lined up on him with his eyes for a hit that would land right above his forehead, and waited, listening to the African screaming in his ear as he did. Then he went still, allowing the kid to gain focus for a split second to take the hit that would put him out of his misery. Just then, the African who hit the dresser came around, stirring and lifting himself from the glass, distracting the kid as he swung the pangar down at the same time that Rann, who was waiting for the very last second, shifted his weight with all his might, swung the African holding him around to take the blow right above his ear.    Before the kid could realize what had just happened, Rann quickly shook the dead man off him, stood, and with a spinning back kick into the kid’s chest, sent him flying across his grandfather’s bed and onto the floor on the other side. Then Rann was up again bobbing on his feet, arms up at his chest getting his breath, surveying the damage, saying to himself “Three dead, two to go.” He spat the dead man’s blood from his mouth and watched the African who hit the dresser look around the room at his three dead comrades.    “Like I said, it’s too late, if you want to say sorry.”     The African was looking for a pangar now, and saw them in the darkness in a pile under the bed—and saw too the one stuck in his friend’s head on the other side of Rann—still bobbing on his toes like he’d been trained, watching him and watching the side of the bed where he’d sent the kid with his broken arm and pangar flying, keeping them both in his line of site. The African stood with his tough bare feet in the broken glass mirror looking for a weapon. Then he saw the shotgun on the floor next to his friend with the crushed windpipe, and ran over to it and picked it up and held it at Rann, getting ready to fire. Rann looked at the two large barrels aiming straight at him and wished the South African had never left it for him as a parting gift, then remembered the guy had given him the shotgun but no cartridges. Rann said in Swahili, “If that was loaded, you’d have already shot me.”    The African smiled back at him with the gun saying, “Maybe it is and I want to shoot you twice, once to bring you down and then next to kill you.”   Rann watched him, trying to work out which end the man was going to use as a club—the barrel or the stock? He knew if it was loaded, there was little he could do at this range. But it wasn’t, there wasn’t any ammo—besides, the guy would have fired by now. The African was still coming at him slowly, laughing and smiling.    “We been here before and we know where the man keep the ammunition Bwana choot and I’m going to shoot you Bwana choot, first in the legs then in the face. I going to blow your legs off first then shoot you in the face, yeah in the face choot boy, in the face.”    And that’s when he raised the gun aimed at Rann’s legs and pulled the trigger. Hearing the trigger but not the hammer releasing, in that split second, Rann was on him, knocking the gun to one side with the palm of his hand and bringing his foot up hard into the African’s chin, knocking his head back and taking him clean off his feet, landing back in the mirror glass behind him. Leaning over as he landed to pick up the gun, Rann held it in his hand as he walked carefully towards the side of the bed where he’d sent the kid flying to see him lying there on the ground, still holding the pangar with which he’d missed Rann and killed his friend—its blade now stuck deep in his side.******Archall Diamond stood above Charles Chuck Chendrill and pulled the trigger, sending another pulse of incapacitating electricity down the gun’s wires and into the dart electrodes that had pierced his clothing and attached themselves to his skin and thought, that’ll do it.    The big ape was now out cold on the ground. Quickly, he slid the two heavy wooden planks out of the back of the truck, attached them, and reached into the back, pulling the hook and wire from the winch and attaching it to Chendrill’s thick leather belt. He hit the switch at the end of the control cord and dragged the big man off the road and up the planks into the rear of his canopied truck, with its big fuck-you wheels, picked up the priest he carried for fishing—so he could administer their last rights—and cracked Chendrill across the back of the head before closing the hatch down.    Taking it easy as he pulled away from the curb, Archall drove for a minute through Burnaby, passing houses and cops and people on their way home from nights out or whatever it was they were doing, getting on with their lives. Archall Diamond was getting on with his. He reached a quiet strip mall and parked up with the rear of his truck against the wall and got out. From what he could tell, it had only been about three minutes since he’d given the big ape a blast and a smack around the head to keep him quiet.    Walking around the back, he looked in, putting his face against the blacked out rear window. Chendrill was still out—at least he hoped. Opening the back slightly, he snuck his hand in and pulled the trigger to the Taser gun he’d left by the door again and watched Chendrill’s body spasm as the current shot down the gun’s thin electrical cables and into his body.    He was out now for certain. Opening up the hatch, he jumped up and climbed in and sat on the wheel well looking at the big guy laying there all fucked up, saying to no one but himself, “You used to be a big man, didn’t you?”   Then he got to work with the first inner tube, pulling its thick rubber over Chendrill’s head, threading his arms through and tucking it up under his armpits. Then he grabbed a chain he’d bought at the store and wrapped it around his ankles tight, fastened it all with tape, added the second inner tube to his feet to stop the chain snagging in the shallows and pulled out an electric battery powered pump. He hit the switch and blew them both up nice and tight, one after the other.    The big ape was ready to go swimming in the swimsuit he’d bought for the dentist to wear, Archall thought as he drove his way out to a quiet spot he knew in the Fraser River. The big man, who’d been going around town asking personal questions about the Diamond, checking him out to see if he was a killer—well guess what, he was. Yeah, he was a killer, a fucking badass motherfucking killer, Archall Di – A – Mond. The man wit his mind on, gonna take you down, make you drown, if you mess with the man in his town. Yeah, he liked that one, he thought, wishing he had a piece of paper to write the words on. But he’d leave out the words drown—didn’t need to leave any clues as to how the Diamond operated, even though he went around telling anyone who cared to listen how they were gonna get floated, but what did that mean? Could be he put them in a balloon, sent them off into the sky. But still, ‘drown’ was no good for a rap, it needed to be something else—maybe to ‘frown’. Maybe.    He stopped at the lights and opened the rear window that connected the driver’s cab to the back of the truck and looked at Chendrill all trussed up like a pig on the way to market with a camo net on its head. Archall stretched his arm through giving him another wallop with the Taser. How many had that been now, he thought. Too many, but what the fuck difference did that make?        He reached the river and crossed it on the Alex Fraser Bridge, swinging north again towards River Road and wondering about the time. He could see the river lit up by the lights from the bridge now—its surface looking calm. The tide out there on the Strait of Georgia was beginning to turn, just around midnight. He looked at the clock on his dashboard illuminated in green—11:50 p.m.    Not yet, he thought, give it half hour to let the rip build at the river’s mouth, then it can drag him south for a while until the air’s all gone from the tube.    He kept on going, heading west along the riverbank, the water to his right, passing the occasional car driving the other way before he snuck into one of the sidings he’d researched a year or so back when he had been thinking of seeing if Rasheed could swim. Checking his mirrors, he turned off the truck’s lights and reversed right to the edge of the river bank and looked at his clock. It was just after midnight. The water was passing him now, fast and strong, heading out towards the ocean.   The funniest thing, he thought, as he sat there reaching into the back to give Chendrill one last long electrical taser blast before he got out, was that after the big ape had left the dentist’s, while her husband was in his surgery he’d asked Alla if she’d consider leaving him so as they could be together and she’d looked him in the eye and said, “I can’t make plans until my surgery and that’s a long way now.”   And Diamond had asked, “Why?”   And taking a deep breath and fighting back tears that were real, Alla had said, lying, “Dennis won’t pay for the operation. But yes, when I’ve had it and I can walk again, I’ll be looking to the future.”   And that was all Archall Diamond needed to hear. She was his for certain and all it was going to take was a quick run upstairs to pick up an easy hundred grand off the bed. And all he needed to do then was get a hold of Rann, sell those tablets for… whatever he needed to make and re-coup the loss he’d incurred giving away the first batch as a promotion and then he’d be sorted. He wouldn’t even notice it, and she’d be up on her feet in time for the hockey season to start.    And that’s why he left his Ray-Bans on when he left the house, because the future was looking so God damn bright. Then he saw Chendrill’s Aston, recognizing it because he liked the wheels and that’s all he could see, and he’d waited there for him to come over to say something smart like he had and then zapped the fucker.    He walked to the back of the truck and picked up a stick and threw it in the water and whoosh it was gone—perfect. Turning around, he looked again through the tinted black windows and opened the back, dropping down the short tailgate, and climbed in, staring at Chendrill all ready to set sail, still in his blue Hawaiian. It was a shame to waste a nice shirt like that, but there you go. The fucker had to go, had to get himself floated, get himself demoted, ’cos he couldn’t keep his nose out of the Diamond’s life. Showing up at his girl’s and trying to look cool and being a pain. Then as he reached for the pin and the gaffer tape he knew the ocean would eventually pull off, he ripped off three pieces and poked the three holes in the tube in front of Chendrill’s face, sealed them up along with one across his mouth and moustache for good measure, then he punctured another six at the top of the tube around his feet and covered them with tape before saying out loud, “I hope you’se took them swimming lessons as a kid Mr. Snooper Dooper Super PI man.”    He sat himself with his back to the bulkhead of the truck’s cab, put his feet on top of the camo netting on Chendrill’s head and shoulders, and began to push Chendill out over the tailgate, dropping him—still unconscious—straight down into the fast-flowing water.  ******Dan sat in his bedroom and thought back to the woman who his mother had said was older than her and wondered how long it had taken for the lady to learn to do a trick like that with her mouth. Marsha hadn’t gone near it with hers, and neither had Melisa. The blind girl in the park was about to try—just before her dog attacked him.    He picked up his phone and looked to it—another text from Marsha, ‘wondering how you are?’ to which he replied, ‘absolutely no different.’ And he wasn’t lying, as nothing had happened over the last twenty minutes, apart from him staining one of Chendrill’s socks. Then he got another one. This time from Sebastian. It read:    Daniel, get some sleep. Tomorrow’s seven am call is really important. Be up and running in the morning first thing—don’t forget. Sebastian.’    Completely ignoring it, he thought, Yeah whatever, and then wondered if maybe older women were the way to go? After all, look at the way the crazy agent from L.A. had reacted in his kitchen, before his mother had kicked her out as well. Maybe it’s just the way they were? No wonder Chuck Chendrill spends so much time here and the baker for that matter, who used to come around at 6:00 a.m. with his tray.    He got up and looked out the window to see if the woman across the road was in her bedroom getting undressed with the curtains open as she often did. No. Then he turned on his computer and typed in Adalia Seychan’s name and watched as a host of information flooded forward. An Oscar, big deal, Golden Globe, another two Oscars, yeah yeah, big deal. He opened the images of her and flipped through Adalia standing there in her gown, statue in hand smiling, then another photo—wow she was hot in the 80s. He recognized her now and remembered his mother crying over some soppy movie she was in when he was a kid, remembering her saying with tears in her eyes as the sun was setting in the sky behind her, ‘You’ll be mine, always be mine.’    So this was the woman he was doing the photo shoot with tomorrow, but what the fuck for? He didn’t know, and didn’t care. This one Sebastian was getting so hot under the collar about and making such a fuss about him being there real early so as he could sit around again for three hours doing nothing and wait for Adalia Seychan to strut out onto that green stage and lick the sweat off his chest just like Marsha had?****** Chuck Chendrill came around just as the inner tubes took him floating out into the open water and the larger waves started hitting his face. What the fuck was happening? He was freezing, wet, in complete darkness and barely able to breathe with his whole-body stiff with cramps.    He looked around in blind panic, as another wave hit him in the face, the riptide taking him quickly out to sea. He was in the ocean, floating. With his hands left free, he felt around him as he started to spin in the water, the lights from the shore small and orange, now almost half a mile away, barely visible as he bobbed up and down in the swell.    Reaching up, he began to pull at the camo net around his head, feeling its thin nylon string digging into his eyes—its bottom fastened loosely around the tube. Something was also on his mouth, loosening now from the sea water. He opened his mouth, breaking the tape’s adhesive seal, as another wave hit him hard, stinging his eyes and washing up his nose. Lifting his hand up, he ripped the netting away from his head, and still holding it in his right hand, he looked around properly as he rose up, peaking in the swell.    Nothing was around, no fishing boats, no yachts making a night sail across to the islands, no ferries, just fast-moving water that was taking him south—and he was cold. He looked at his feet lit up by the full moon as they bobbed up and down, the fresh new chain he’d seen hanging up in Archall Diamond’s garage was now wrapped around his ankles holding the other tube just under the water at an upright angle. Something was on top, silver in color, another strip of tape, then he saw a similar strip on the inner tube under his arms keeping his body up.      He moved along in the water, pushing the chain with his legs, trying to free it from his ankles. The rip tide was pulling him down the coast. His body felt solid, hurting and in pain from the tasering and freezing cold. As he spun slowly in the water, he said to himself, “You’re still breathing, you’re still breathing.”   He remembered coming up behind Archall and almost dodging the Taser gun, cussing himself for underestimating the man and thinking he was a fool. He took a deep breath and let the sea air fill his lungs, feeling the drips of salt water pull up inside his nostrils, stinging as they went. Let it out, breathe, he thought as he said to himself again, trying to keep his lips closed as he spoke.    “You’re still alive, you’re still alive.”   He looked to the land, the mouth of the river was nowhere to be seen now, the lights of the mainland distant. He looked to his watch—it was still there, Diamond had not thought to steal it, or just didn’t care. Either way, it was on his wrist and still working despite the salt water.    It was just coming up to twelve thirty now. He’d left Dennis’ before ten and waited till Diamond came out at around eleven—and that was in Burnaby. It was a half hour trip to the coast from there and he still had to prep this shit and get him in the water. Half hour, half hour tops, he’d been in the water, floating.    “I’m still here, still breathing.”   He was out a long way, but it wasn’t the first time he’d been out this far floating, not swimming. It had been about the same time of year, out there with his friends swimming in English Bay when he was a kid, taking it easy with them, cruising out slowly to the freight ships way out there on a hot summer’s day, taking an hour or two to get there floating on their backs in their shorts chatting as the water lapped around them, feeling the warmth of the sun on their faces and chests and the cold of the water the deeper their legs went.    Back then, they would reach the ships, looking up at them from below, painted monoliths of rust-stained steel rising up from the water, and swim to the rudder, hanging on its back with their feet on the propeller tops, climbing and diving from the ship’s coned nose, lounging on it in the sun as they listened to the crew talking above in a foreign tongue as they worked on deck—unseen people from some distant land oblivious to Chendrill and his friends trespassing below.    But that was twenty-five years ago, Chendrill thought, though the water’s temperature was the same give or take a couple of degrees. He hurt, yes, his body was tight and in pain, but he could still move his hands and arms and feet. And he was still alive.    And then as a wave hit him, slapping the tubes and stinging his face, he looked to his feet to see the tape loose now, flapping in the cold sea breeze. He stared at it, then at the one in front of his face with its adhesive beginning to give. Reaching in, he lifted a corner of the tape, peeling it back and instantly heard the hissing of air as he uncovered the first pin prick. Shit, he thought, bad move, bad move. He tried to smooth the tape back down with his fingers then smother it, holding it flat with his palm as he felt the cold of the water splash up across the top of his hand.    He looked to the tube at his feet, getting smaller now as he felt the weight of his legs and the chains begin to shift his position in the water until he could no longer see his legs and felt the colder, deeper water at his feet.      Shit.    He looked to the tape on the tube now only inches from his face and could hear the faint hissing as the air escaped from beneath his palm and he felt the weight of the chain around his legs trying to pull him under. Then another wave hit him fast, sucker punching him from the side, catching him unaware, feeling its stinging cold in his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, forcing its way through his tightly pursed lips into his mouth and down his throat, choking him.    Coughing and wheezing, Chendrill gathered himself, fighting for breath, spitting out sea water, and then finding his breath again. He breathed in a deep lungful of air, smelled rubber and looked to the tape which was now gone. Quickly, he slapped his hand on it and for the first time called out for no one to hear. He kicked as hard as his body could on the chain around his ankles, pulling up and pushing down, feeling the flesh rip from his skin with the force, up down, up down, forward backward, up down, up down. The water lapping around his ears, going up his nose. The air from the tube bubbling around his feet as he slammed his feet up and down and around and around like a cyclist, feeling the tension of the chain differ with every kick, the links shifting with every movement, the inner tube getting softer.    Then watching the air escape under his hands, Chendrill pushed his head forward, covering the holes with his mouth, sealing the pin holed area with his lips, pushing down on the tubes, feeling the salt water in his eyes and running directly up his nose as he kicked and kicked with his feet. His mind racing, as he said to himself over and over, ‘You’re still alive, you’re still alive, you’re not dead yet.’ Locking his mouth around the tube as it got softer, the chain pulling on the remaining air in the tube, Chendrill bit hard on the tube’s rubber, trying to seal the holes off with his teeth as the riptide carried him along in the water.    He continued to kick as the waves splashing above him covered his head, dipping his face completely under the water, then he stopped kicking, shifted his weight, arched his back and neck, forcing the inner tube up into the crook of his neck, trying to lay on his back with his face against the night sky as he bit into the rubber and held the soft tube against his face. He gripped and squeezed the tube with either side of his mouth, sealing it as best he could with each hand forcing whatever air was left behind him as he hung there in the moving current, feeling its water cold on his face as each swell hit.    Reaching down with one hand, he tried to reach the laces on his boots, pulling his knees up to him as he did, feeling the chain tightening around his legs then his cold fingertips touching the top of his boots, the laces double knotted tight as he always liked to do. Then in frustration he started to kick again with incredible fury, irrespective of pain, he pushed and pulled harder than he thought possible, feeling as though any moment his legs would snap off and drop down to the seabed.    Then just as Chendrill managed to get a full breath of air through his nose, the chain pulled him under, dropping him slowly deeper into the water. He felt the temperature change around his body as he slowly sank down towards the seabed, holding his breath the best he could, the water pressure squeezing his ears as he dropped. Sucking and biting into the rubber with his teeth, opening up a small hole with his incisors and releasing what little air he could through one clasped hand as he reached down with the other, lifting his body, rotating it in the cold dark water, grabbing the chain with his free hand and shaking it as he spun himself around and around, pulling and pulling, trying to feel for the chain’s end as he sucked on the foul-tasting, life-giving air from within the tube. Then he found it with a finger, the chain’s end attached to another piece with a small plastic cable tie already stretched from his determination.    Taking a deep breath from the tube, Chendrill dug his fingers in, wrapped his free hand around the chain, and pulled it as hard as he could, jerking it and jerking it as he slowly floated downward. Then with a snap he felt the tension give and the chain loosen as he kicked and pulled and spun his body around in the water until he felt it drop away. He continued to kick and his body began to rise back up towards the surface. The pressure loosened from his ears, the temperature changed as he rose through the water, the remaining air in the tube clasped firmly in his teeth pulling him up and up until he burst through the surface back into the swell.     Chendrill lay there on his back in the swell looking up to the sky, his heart racing as he felt the water splash on his face again, but he did not care. Trying to relax with as little effort as possible he stayed still, swirling one hand at his sides enough to keep him afloat as he moved along with the current, drifting up and down on the swell. He was tired and cold and hurt all over. The water was cold on his feet, his boots now gone—squeezed and shaken off despite their laced double knots—but he was still alive, just.    He lifted his arm from the water and looked at his watch, which was still there and working just fine. Just like me, he thought, just like me. From what he could tell, he was still only about two miles from shore, the lights faint in the distance as the riptide eased. It was almost one a.m. Twenty years prior, he’d spend a good four hours out on the ocean, in the bay. This experience wasn’t new to him, and as long as he cruised with the current instead of against it, taking it as slow as he needed to, edging bit by bit towards the shore, letting the current do the work, he’d make it—unless his heart gave out.    So, he lay there on his back, resting, relaxing, drifting with the current, and once he began to get his wind and felt whatever strength he had left begin to return, he let go of the inner tube that had saved his life; and flipping onto his stomach, as he had as a young man so many years ago, he began to swim calmly and surely away from the current and back towards land.    It was almost three in the morning when he first felt the seabed beneath his feet and stood for a moment in a shallow with the water at his chest, staring at the land now only some three hundred feet away with its rocky shale beach covered with logs pushed high by the tide and further still by storms.   He leaned forward and pushed himself into the now calm water and, exhausted, gently cruised quietly towards the shore, finally reaching land and pulling himself from the water. He stepped up twelve feet onto the beach, lay between two huge cedars and, smiling to himself, slept in the warm night air.    An hour later he woke, feeling his body ache all over. He crouched between the logs, finding the strength to carry on, then eventually stood. There were houses there beyond the beach safe from the rising tide, long gardens with cut grass and swing sets and chairs ready for the sun, which would be along soon. Chendrill looked to one with its big cedar shakes, painted dark green and flying the stars and stripes proudly from its rooftop. He was in the United States, he thought, and wondered why he hadn’t seen the flag as he’d come ashore.    Anyone in their right mind would go and knock on the door and ask for help, have the police and ambulance come take him away to a warm bed with about five hundred questions and news crews. He’d sit there like a chump in a private room and watch his story unfold on KOMO News—with pictures of Archall Diamond being arrested, showing off his fucking front tooth to the cameras. But that wasn’t his style. He needed to cross the border, get back into Canada—besides it was almost 4:15 a.m. and he needed to pick up Dan in a couple of hours.    He took a deep breath and felt his clothing, his Hawaiian still damp but not too bad, his jeans damper. Crouching down, he took off his socks, then doing the same with his jeans he saw the heavy bruising around his ankles and shins from the chain.    He rung out his socks and felt the swelling along his shins and ankles. It was bad, but it could have been worse, he thought. He looked to the house, whoever was in there asleep now. Then he remembered his phone and pulled it out and looked at it as he sat back down behind the log in his underpants and looked out to the sea that had nearly taken him. Hitting the button, he gave it a try, nothing—not surprising though. Digging back into his pocket, he pulled out the keys to the Aston and his wallet. Diamond hadn’t taken anything, he thought, just trussed him up and thrown him in the drink.    He placed the wallet and phone to one side and wrung out his jeans and shirt, feeling his hands shake as he did. Then, putting everything back on, he grabbed his keys and wallet and felt his shoulder ache as he threw the phone back into the ocean and said, “That’s all you get of me, Archall Diamond.”   He walked north feeling the rocks beneath his feet along the beach for fifteen minutes until he could see the first border camera and a black SUV patrol car passing in the distance. He knew the border well, hanging out there on the other side often as a kid and then as a young man. ‘The Border’—at Zero Avenue in Canada, was little less than a two-foot ditch separating two countries and their different attitudes. Patrolled by land and air and watched by camera diligently on the south side from the Pacific to the Atlantic, the north was patrolled by air sometimes and by land occasionally—it’s the way it was.    Staying away from the cameras, Chendrill cut inland, feeling the ground beneath his feet slide in his still damp socks. He reached the road and stood in the darkness at the side of a tree and stared at the open border a good thousand feet away in the distance. Then he saw the black SUV coming back his way from the south and sinking back into the trees, he let it pass, following it with his eyes as it cruised along and settled in a siding some five hundred feet ahead.    The driver sat there with his engine running and all his lights off so as no one could see him hidden in his huge black vehicle, looking north—Chendrill wanting to go north. Waiting and watching, Chendrill looked to his watch. It was coming up to a quarter to five. He could do it, he thought, jump the border as he had as a kid, running across and running back again for a dare. Watching the border patrol come screaming along from the south and then hiding from the RCMP on his side in the north.    The guy was still sitting there five minutes later, his silhouette unmoved in the vehicle’s cab. If he was lucky, the guy would be asleep, taking an unscheduled work nap in a spot where the cameras couldn’t see him and Chendrill could sneak past in the trees, then make the quick dash and jump the huge two-foot ditch. But he was no longer a kid, and the world had been a different place back then.    Slowly he moved forward from the rear, the silence of the night broken by the SUV’s idling engine, the border patrol officer’s balding head unmoving, visible through the rear window. He stopped by a tree and waited, the guy had to be asleep. Then suddenly he moved, his duck pond head turning around and looking out to the side, then the door opened and he got out.    Chendrill stayed still and watched as the man wandered around the vehicle. There was still time to approach the man, he thought, tell him his tall story that it would take him a day to prove after he’d come clean.             Then with the engine still running, the man walked away from the vehicle into the woods, stopping some hundred feet away out of sight of any cameras to unzip his fly, and, with his back to his vehicle, he started to pee. Chendrill moved closer, listening to the engine running. The big man in his Hawaiian and socks made his way through the darkness along the side of the SUV and opened the door and quietly sat, feeling the warmth inside. Quickly, he slammed the thing into drive and sped off as fast as the vehicle could travel—the sound of gunshots ringing in the air. He hit the border barrier, and slammed the patrol officer’s vehicle across the ditch with a crash and a thump and bounced his way back into Canada.    He had less than five minutes before the whole international incident fully hit the grid, Chendrill thought, as he pulled the SUV to its left and made his way away from the officer, who he could only assume was still shooting at him. Seeing a right turn heading north, he took it and carried on up as far as he could, then took another right and a left, hit a main road, and screamed it along for almost half a mile until he was in the heart of Tsawwassen and saw a bus terminal. He slowed and snuck into a side road, parked the SUV in the driveway of an abandoned house that was due to be demolished, wiping everything down with the border patrol’s napkin. He grabbed the guy’s water bottle and sandwiches wrapped up in silver foil, and headed barefoot for the bus station.    It was 5:00 a.m.   It was two minutes past 5:00 a.m. when he heard and saw the RCMP cars go screaming past, heading south to the border and a minute after that, he heard the helicopter fly overhead as he sat on the bus, waiting for it to move and taking the first bite out of the patrol officer’s cheese and ham sandwich.    It was bad, he knew it. This guy who’s snack he was now eating was in a lot of trouble, he thought as he felt the engine of the first bus into Vancouver that morning start up and pull away, but there you go, as the old saying goes—you snooze you lose, or better still, always take your keys with you when you leave the vehicle for a piss. The poor guy, Chendrill thought as the bus took a turn onto the highway. He looked at the people all around him on a journey they probably took every day, just as the guy whose career he’d just put a dent in had probably taken a piss at the same tree every time he was on duty.    By 5:45 a.m., the bus was in Vancouver and Chendrill got out, feeling his whole body stiffen as he tried to move. Hurting badly, he raised his right arm and hailed a cab and with bleary eyes saw the turbaned driver and wondered if it was Dan’s friend as he sat in the back. He gave the driver the address to Dan’s mother’s place and thirty minutes later when he opened his eyes, he was there. It was ten minutes after 6:00 a.m. and Dan was still asleep.    He opened the door with the key he kept on the same ring as the Aston’s and shouted down the stairs to Dan to wake up as he passed through. He opened the door to Trish’s room as she turned the bedside light on and sat up saying, “Chuck, I’ve been worried sick, I’ve been trying to call.”    Chendrill said as he came in and sat on the bed, “Sorry, my phone got wet; it’s not working.”    Then she looked at him closely, kissed him on the cheek, and said, “Oh my God! You look awful!”    “Thanks.”    “No Chuck, what on earth happened? Something’s terrible has been going on, I had a really bad feeling that something had happened to you. I thought you were dead and now you’re here, thank God, but you’re covered in salt; it’s all over your face and in your hair.”    Chendrill thought, you thought I was dead, so did I love. His woman wasn’t wrong, she’d felt it whatever it was, out there in the ether. Then Chendrill looked at his watch, took a deep breath and said, “I’m fine, don’t worry. Dan needs to get ready. He has to be there in forty-five minutes.”    He walked to the top of the stairs and called down, “Dan get up, we’re leaving.”    He heard Dan reply, saying, “Tell them I’m not coming in. I’m tired and I feel sick.”   He’s sick, Chendrill thought as he stood at the top of the stairs, feeling the bump on the back of his head for the first time. Not feeling well—fuck me after what he’d just gone through and he’s still on time, then he felt a temper rush through him borne of tiredness and frustration as he shouted down, “Be ready outside with the keys to your car in fifteen minutes or I’ll be down there and I’ll drag you out by your fucking hair.”    Then he turned and walked back to the bedroom and as soon as he saw Trish, he apologized.    She said, “It’s okay.” Then, she said, “Do you want to take a shower? I’ve got some of your clothes you left here clean in the cupboard.” Chendrill looked to her and noticed her hands were shaking. But the truth was, so were his. He got up and walked into the bathroom and stripped down, and saw the salt lines in his dark denim trousers lying on the floor, his lower legs bruised to the bone, a mix of red and blue. Then Trish came in seeing them immediately and burst into tears.    Chendrill said, “It’s okay, I just had an accident, it’s okay.”   “I knew it,” Trish said as she bent down to look at his legs, “I knew it.”   Then as he turned on the shower, Chendrill said, “Could you make sure he’s ready. I’m feeling a little tired and I don’t want to embarrass myself again shouting at him.”    He looked to his watch—it was now twenty after. He’d forget shaving and be out in five minutes. He stepped in and put his head under the warm water, immediately tasting the sea salt as it ran down his face from his hair and skin as it all came rushing back to him as the words, ‘I’m still alive, I’m still alive,’ whirled through his mind.   By 6:30 a.m. he stepped outside in clean clothes. Dan stood there looking pissed off. Trish was holding the Ferrari’s keys and asking if he’d like her to drive him and continued with, “You haven’t got long.”   Chendrill grabbed them, saying, “Don’t worry, I’m driving a Ferrari. I’ll be there in no time.”   They pulled out onto the main road and headed towards Iron Works Studio, Chendrill feeling every muscle in his body hurt as he turned the wheel, especially his left leg and ankle as he used the clutch. Moving out into the inside lane, he put his foot down and listened to the Ferrari roar and go nowhere fast. Dan looked at him smirking. Then said, “Yeah, frustrating init.” Then Dan said, “The way this sex machine drives, we’ll be lucky if we get there tomorrow.”   They arrived at three minutes past 7:00 a.m. and pulled up next to Sebastian, who was waiting in the carpark with the face of a man who’s been forced to work a long weekend. He said, “You’re late, Chuck.”   Chendrill looked to his watch as he struggled to get out of the car. Sebastian wasn’t wrong; he couldn’t deny it. He said, “Yeah sorry, I had some problems.”   And totally out of character, Sebastian said, “I’ve got problems too, Chuck. You’re not the only one—I’ve got a sore back, but I made it in on time.”   Then Dan piped up, passing them as he walked towards the caterers, “That’s what happens when you stick governors on Ferraris.”****** Rann Singh pulled the key from his pocket and opened the door. He left the bedroom without looking back and locked it again from the hallway. Carrying the shotgun along, he walked out onto the deck and sat down on his grandfather’s chair and stared at the mountains, now backlit by the sun as it began to light the morning sky to the east.    His back hurt in and around his kidneys. Those fucking pricks coming into his home with their pangar swords like they owned it. But they were dead and gone now, four of them at least, the big one that hit the dresser, maybe not. But there you go, he did warn them. He took a deep breath, the mountain air cooling his lungs, the sweat from the fight drying now on his back and brow, the taste of another man’s blood still in his mouth.    That had been a fight, he thought, a good one. Those guys were strong, really strong and tough as old boots. Except the young one, poor guy going with them trying to be dangerous when he wasn’t. Dead now, when he should have stayed down with a busted knee and arm like he’d told him. There you go, sometimes you don’t know who you’re fucking with. He felt calm now, incredibly calm. The shit with the zebra all forgotten, the South African off the hook—for now at least, unless Rann had a trip to the coast and saw him and the guy wasn’t in any hurry to offer up an apology on account of having called him a choot, or for having given him the gift of a shotgun he knew no longer fired.     He closed his eyes and thought about what had just happened when less than ten minutes ago he’d been asleep in his bed. And for once, he remembered everything. No blacking out this time as he had so many times before when he’d lost his temper in the street or at the final of a martial arts tournament, when he’d come around on the mat, pinned down by coaches and officials with bloody noses, seeing carnage and his opponent knocked out on the floor as he looked around.    Then they’d banned him, barred him for life for winning a fight and awarded the trophy to the guy he’d left unconscious on the mat. A week after, the call had come asking him if he wanted to earn some money by getting into a cage with an animal—except the animal was a human who’d told his managers to go find someone who knows how to fight, telling them straight, “I don’t want to fight no chump.”   And in Rann went, entering the packed arena with a hanky covering his hair tied up on the center of his head, listening to the crowd roar with laughter, seeing the tough guy who didn’t want to fight no chump standing around shaking his arms with his tattooed muscles and sweat and plastic girlfriends with their big fake titties stretching their T-shirts tight. Rann listened to the guy once the cage door closed as he called Rann a black, Paki, Indian cunt, and, as he posed for the cameras, told him how he was going to rip that hanky from his head and kill him. Then he came at him, swinging and charging and missing as Rann bobbed and weaved—the guy using up his strength trying to catch him, trying to put him down on the mat so as he could choke Rann out, then stand there triumphant with his hands in the air like a gladiator who’d killed another lion. But this time it was different. Rann moved fast, punishing the man’s knees every time he came close with a lunge or a kick or a swipe—the bull of a man almost getting there but getting nowhere, full of sweat, getting frustrated and too full of steroids to move fast, using his mouth as a weapon, calling Rann a Paki cunt over and over until Rann had had enough of the animal’s mouth and put his foot in it and then put another in his throat as he went down on his back and swallowed his tongue. Then Rann stood there watching as the officials and ambulance men tried to bring him round as the crowd screamed and yelled at him, telling him how they were now going to kill him if he’d killed their tattooed hero. And he had.    Then the next morning, the metropolitan police came to his grandfather’s home to chat, only to find Rann gone along with his prize money.        He leaned back looking at the silent sky as the orange grew, remembering his grandfather’s words, he wasn’t wrong in not wanting to come here, and now he saw why. What if it had been him lying there in his bed with his grandmother when the men from the mountains came? What if Rann was out of town? What if his granddad were there slowly being carved up until he gave them the cash he’d been hiding away for a rainy day. The man was right—his life was there in the England now, living near the airport, watching soaps and listening to Radio 2 as the airplanes landed.    Then, as he leaned his head back, breathed deep and closed his eyes, a calmness deeper than he’d ever known enveloped him as the now clear, once blacked out memories unfolded. Girls on his bed with their blonde hair, the dog he loved as a kid laying asleep with its head on his lap as it died, then seeing it running as fast as it could through the park. His parents holding each other and him before they took that ill-fated journey along the Great West Road and passed on. The kids at school bullying him all the time until he took himself off to the gym to learn how to defend himself and kept training night by night until they stopped.    Then he thought of Chendrill, laughing as he remembered the big fucker hitting him in the street, harder than he’d ever been hit, catching him unaware when he was thinking about pussy and knocking him to the ground. Then getting him back outside the fish restaurant and better still telling him he was a dumb fuck on the phone at the kinky guy’s place who liked to dress up as a postman. And Rasheed, standing at the side of the busy road and pissing him off, the guy there getting all gangster with him and Rann getting mad when it didn’t really matter now. He thought of Rasheed seeing his face and the anger in his eyes, the gangster looking scared and stepping back too close to the traffic and getting clipped by the passing truck that didn’t stop. He remembered holding the man, seeing the light go from his eyes and seeing the smile on the idiot with the diamond in his tooth’s face when he realized he had.   Then the Irishman was there in his mind, drunk and stinking of whisky at the top off those stairs with his girl who’d just been around with her friend and fucked his brains out. The Irishman getting greedy, trying to rip him off and writing on the picture of the King, then his girl there with him, shouting at him in a fury to stop in English and then in Thai—and he wasn’t listening, telling her to fuck off and her getting angry, whipping her leg up fast hitting him in the chest twice like one of the prize fighting kickboxers he’d seen touring the bars of Bangkok, making the Irishman drop the pen and stumble back, his legs buckling under him as he tried to get air into his winded body, then one foot catching the edge of the stair slipping down, his body following, rolling over and over head to toe, his eyes looking up at Rann at the bottom and the man’s girlfriend—or whatever she was, he or she—it didn’t matter now—gone. At least he hadn’t killed the man like he thought he had—or Rasheed for that matter; in fact, he hadn’t killed anyone except the cage fighter and the guys in his bedroom he’d asked to leave after they’d just told him they were about to kill him.     Then he felt the pain in his back grow and wondered where Joseph was. He was thirsty and now remembered the African slamming him against the wall and feeling his small coat hook he’d used as a kid break off as it punctured his skin, leaving itself inside like a huge splinter to rip up his insides as he fought like he’d never fought before.    He looked to the mountains feeling his insides go numb as they bled and listened to the first people in the village wake, knowing Joseph would be along soon with his tea and he could tell him what had happened and ask him to call the police.    Then he looked back to the mountain, with its jagged range clawing at the sunrise as the sun began to rake its slopes, laying its rays across the treetops of the forest, catching the morning dew on the fields that were now his, fields that stretched all the way from the forest to the garden that the women from the village who his grandfather knew so well swept in the afternoon—and where his mother and father now stood, waiting for their only son to come join them.
