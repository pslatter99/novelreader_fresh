Chapter Three      ‘BoysTown’ a place of mystery, sat hidden away from the world at the end of a small soi and when I eventually found it, I could not believe the zone had escaped me prior as I’d walked the length and breadth of this city.       The whole area a mini gay version of Pattaya snuggled inside the city. Instead of girls standing outside of the bars or dancing half naked on the stages, there were men. The bars loaded with handsome guys mostly of a younger age. Their customers a million miles away from the cargo short pants and wife beater wearing hoards that frequented the rest of the city. Handsomely groomed men of all ages, most completely out and others wishing they could be as they were at that moment no doubt just for this particular trip. Uber gay Thai men with bright underwear showing through thin silk or linen suits wandering the streets.       Steve sitting in amongst the rainbow flag waving hoard and standing out to me like a sore thumb. The kid just staring at a line of dancers in a bar three venues down from where he was sitting. 	      I sat myself down next to him and as he looked up for a second, I saw the minutest glimpse of surprise, then as he looked back towards the dancers in the bar, he heard me say.      “When you going to stop being a complete and utter cunt all your life?”       Steve nodding. As he took that one in. Then he said.  	“you took your time?”Fuck me, I thought. The guy had said over and over how he was going to handle it, and I wasn’t to come. Now he was complaining that I wasn’t quick enough, Steve then said. 	“Mum wants you to call her she’s worried.” Confused, I replied. 	“She tell you I’m looking for you?”	“Yeah.”	“And you didn’t think you should call me or something? Or even get her to tell me where you were?” He didn’t. It was just the way he was I suppose. The guy trying to fix his little issue on his own, no doubt. But wishing I was there with him to help. Then with his eyes still fixed on the bar away from the one he was sitting in, he said. 	“See that guy there with the muscles in the pink undies? Well, he knows where my Sherri is.” His Sherri? I thought. So that was the girls name who’d fleeced him, having either not heard it at all, or simply forgotten it quickly as he’d droned on and on about her prior on the phone. I stared at the Thai man as he danced away gyrating his hips, all covered in oil. The guy smiling at the western men as he waved his ass.	“How do you know that? I asked.	“Because he’s, her brother.”	“You met him?”	“Briefly”   	“Yeah, in the street, he was with his wife and kids.”Confused I shook my head as I took that one in, turned and looked to my brother, then back to the stage. 	“Sorry?”	“Yeah - he’s not gay,”	“He’s not?”	“No – He’s straight, as an arrow, same as us. Does this for a living and drives a cab when no one’s knocking on his rear door, when things here get slow, if you know what I mean.” 	I did.	“And you know this – How?”	“Because I ask questions and I’m not stupid.”      Well, that was to be debated.             I asked,	“If you’ve met him, how do you know he has not seen you?”	“he hasn’t.”	“yeah - but how do you know?”	“Because he told me all us white guys look the same.”I sat back and watched the guy in his pink undies for a moment then looked around. It was certainly a sausage-fest and there was definitely a vast discrepancy in the look of the two of us and the style and expensive neatly cut haircuts of the majority of gay men we sat amongst. I looked down at myself in my freshly cut off jeans and big work boots. Then Steve said,	“You see that guy sitting at the table with grey hair, white shirt and fancy dickie bow tie?” I looked through the crowd to the tables, sifting from one man to the next, until I thought I’d found the person Steve was referring to. 	“Yeah - go on?”	“well, he’s the guy who suggested I buy that bar.”	“And?”	“said it was a good idea.”	“And?”	“well, he was full of shit.”	“And you’re surprised by this?”Steve thought about that one. Then answered me with,	Well, I wasn’t suspicious until I saw him here talking to Sherri’s brother.”	“Sherri?” I asked again, making sure I had the name right.	“Yeah – Sherri - My fiancée, fuck me. How many more times I gotta say it. We were supposed to be getting married tomorrow.”	This came as news to me. 	“What? Like officially married with government stamps and everything?” I asked. “Or you saying like a private bullshit marriage, between you and her without a rubber stamp?”	“Proper - And don’t be getting all pouty faced about it either. We’d have let you and mum know once it was all done. Had a party planned when we got back to Alberta for the both of you.”Thanks for nothing.With my nose put out of joint, and not getting ‘pouty,’ I looked about. A group of roided body builders in muscle shirts sat a table over eyeing up the talent as a collection of masculine ladyboys floated past. Then a skinny man passed by also wearing a tight top, holding hands with his Thai boyfriend. The body builders following him with their eyes. Openly smirking at the young man’s physique, making him feel self-conscious. The stares to the man from these simple-minded bullies ending as they met mine. But any opinion these pricks had on this man I’d never met or ever would was none of my business and had nothing to do with me. So, I looked at them all and said out loud, 	“Fat roided bully cunts!”  Then leaving that out there, I turned back to Steve, and carried on with,       “And you’re a bigger one.” Steve saying straight back without missing a beat,      “Still got that thing then?”Yes, I still had that thing.      Even though Steve had heard it all before, and he was doing his best to ignore it, I could see that one cut deep. But fuck him what could I do. The truth hurt I suppose, and he deserved it. Not inviting myself and mum to his wedding. Not that I’d have gone to this ‘wedding’ that is. Knowing our mother would not want to go without our father and I’d never have left her alone on such a special day. I took a deep breath and let it out. That was it, I would let that one go, not mention it again. Then without the minutest piece of guilt for my previous words, I carried on with,	“You’re still a cunt.” Steve then smiled, ignoring me, and said quietly.	“I like it better here, if you put all the gay shit to one side. The music’s better, and most of all, apart from those Mr. Universe wannabe’s, it’s not full of low life’s.”	I looked about and gave that one some thought. Steve was correct, where were all the alcoholics’, the predators, the rape gangs, the scruffy fucks, and the lost and lonely, I’d spent the last couple of days wandering through. I said,	“they weren’t all losers from what I could tell.” And reality was there were normal people there as well, people just like myself. The curious. Observing this exhibition of man-made human debauchery, much like patrons of a zoo. Except here, there was no moat or fence or giant window made from reinforced glass, the lookers on were inside the walls. Steve asked,	“You at my hotel?”	“Yeah, the manager wants a word with you about the minibar.”	“well when you next see him, tell him to stop basing his pricing on Paris.”	“You never been to Paris.”	“Don’t need to now.” 	“Anyway, no need, I paid it.”Steve then looked at me as though I’d done him a huge injustice. 	“What the fuck for?”	“I’m staying there – I didn’t need the dagger eyes okay?”	“Now I suppose I owe you $7000, plus the mini bar?”What the fuck was this, the man had lost $70,000. I thought, so I said.	“Maths was never your strong point was it?”Steve took a deep breath, thinking about that one, Then said,       “I only asked for seven – mum fucked up there, not me.”Even so he’d lost it, But I did not get around to reminding him of that small detail, as the next thing Steve said took me even more by surprise. The man drawing in the deepest of breaths before saying.  	“You know I’ve been sitting here for the last few days and the only thing I’ve been thinking is whether our father would of been thinking about guys in fluorescent undies when he fucked mum.” 	“Maybe?” I answered, and the moment I had, I wished I hadn’t entertained the stupidity of the comment. Steve then carrying on saying.	“you ever think he came to places like this with that guy?” I shrugged,       “does it matter?” I said, and I wasn’t wrong, it didn’t. Dad was gone and we missed him. The guy living his life in a cage he’d built for himself. And giving his own life up when that same cage broke open. Steve then suddenly said something that surprised me more than finding my brother sitting here in the first place.	“I’d have happily taken a dad who came here over what he’s left us with.” But that was an option we’d never been given. The man in such panic after being suddenly outed not giving any of us that choice. Steve then carried on,	“no wonder he did all that rolling around on the floor with other guys at the gym.”And he had done just that. Along with us both, there in the guise of learning the same self defence techniques which involved man handling your opponent into some intricately worked out floor move that cumulated with some other guys sweaty ass or crutch stuck in your face.      And as it dawned on me that my brother was perhaps sitting here for no other reason than he missed our father and that these two guys three bars down, one of which was gyrating in pink undies was nothing other than that, so I said.       “Dad’s gone Steve - Let it go.”      Then we sat for a moment again, both in silence. Two boys who loved girls, comfortable in a world as foreign to them as a Saharan shepherd at a Christian revival meeting, simply because it had been a slither of our fathers world. I gave it sometime, then took a deep breath.      “So what do you want to do?”      Steve shrugged and as he did I doubted his plan went further than buying another beer. I picked up the one Steve had not long before ordered for himself, “Listen.” I said      “If this guy here or the one up on that stage is not who you say he is. It’s okay.”Turning, Steve stared at me. The man now confused by my words.      “What?” He answered straight back in complete confusion. I carried on.      “If you’re here because you miss dad – you know - It’s okay, you don’t need to make up excuses.” Sitting there Steve thought about that one as he looked into the bar directly opposite, watching an oil soaked Thai man give him the eye. Taking a deep breath, he replied,“Feel free to leave whatever fucking psychology degree you found on the internet back at the hotel…. I’m here because Sherri’s brother is slapping his little Asian dick about up there on that stage being watched by the same guy who told me it was a good idea to invest in that shithole of a building. You think it’s anything different, that’s on you.”      “Just saying it’s okay - that’s all.” I said back, not giving in.      “Fuck off.” Hearing that, we both, sat in silence again for a moment as Steve pretended I wasn’t there. The body builders with their tight shirts clinging to their steroid induced soft muscle still smarting from the slight I’d slapped them with. The pricks giving me the occasional detestable glance.       “If you don’t believe me, go ask the guy.” Steve then said, without looking me in the eye.      “pretend you’re like dad, make out like you want to fuck and then beat a confession out of him.”      I laughed, good old Steve. When all else has failed just turn instead to violence. So that’s exactly what I decided to do.                      				***********                  I moved along to the bar and sat myself down. The man who was very nearly Steve’s brother-in-law now staring at my work boots. The fella covered in more oil than I’d seen working the tar sands. The man moving his gaze, staring me in the eyes, his mouth biting out at nothing.       Fuck me this is awkward, I thought, as I stared back and gestured for him to go upstairs. The man mouthing back to me 5000 Baht as he held five fingers in the air to make sure I understood.       Without a second thought I was up and heading towards the stairs. The man who was supposedly as straight as myself and drove a taxi in the off days, doing his best not to slip as he climbed off the stage to follow.       I reached the top and stopped. Then waited for Steve’s brother-in-law to catch up. The low voiced screams and panting of men now very apparent. Their animalistic tones floating out from behind closed doors that lined the corridor I now stood within. A very male looking Ladyboy exited a room and stared into my eyes as she passed me by. Steve’s brother-in-law reached the top of the stairs and without looking at me moved past. Then with the slightest of glances back, he disappeared into a room.        When I entered he was already sitting on the bed. The man’s oil soaked body glistening in the neon light from the window. The noise of the music now more apparent as it thumped through the floor. Looking at me the man said.      “Five thousand baht.”  And putting my hand into my pocket, I pulled out some money counted it and walking over held out my hand to pass him the money. As soon as his hand was next to mine I had his greasy wrist in the clasp of my hand and I had pulled him to the floor. Then, with a move I’d practiced for years with my father, I had him in an arm bar with one leg across his neck and the other behind his head as I stretched his arm back across my thigh until I thought there was little else for the joint to do other than to leave the man’s shoulder socket.       Doing my best to stop my hands slipping on his oily skin. I then used the sweaty  underside of my knee to cover his mouth and silence his screams.       Moments later the door burst open and Steve rushed in. He looked to the man on the floor covered in oil, with his eyes popping out of his head, and said.      “You fucking idiot, you got the wrong guy.”Letting the pressure off the man’s arm, but keeping him held fast I looked up at my brother.      “What the fuck are you talking about.”      “He’s the wrong guy!” I looked to the man’s pink underpants, then back to Steve. I said,	“They’re pink – you said the guy in pink undies?”	“I know - but I meant fuchsia.”Jesus Christ, my brother was stupid. I felt the man beneath my legs fighting to get his breath. Letting go of the pressure on his mouth and nose with my leg I felt him panic as I watched his eyes staring up at Steve. 	“I not know where sister!”What? I thought, did I hear that right? Not quite believing I’d accidently got the right guy, Steve stared down at the guy on the floor. The man still looking back in panic. 	“Sister bad woman – not here – I tell…” Letting go of the guy, I quickly got to my feet as the Thai man stood, then holding his ruptured shoulder sat himself on the edge of the bed. Still looking at Steve but wary of myself, he carried on. 	“She with her husband.”	“She’s Married?” Steve barked back in disbelief as he unconsciously held onto his head. And before the man could say another word the door opened and the Ladyboy who’d passed me five minutes prior stepped into the room. Taking a moment to size up the situation, and before I could move, she’d span around in her heels with a kick straight out of the Mai Thai knock out handbook and caught me straight in my hands as I guarded my chest and sent me off balance and staggering back straight through the centre of the window. 	With shattered glass all around me and the air completely gone from my lungs, I felt my body hit the outside canopy of the bar I’d just been sitting at and bounce off the tight fabric before I dropped another seven feet and hit a row of motorbikes lined up below. The bikes leaning at an angle and collapsing perfectly enough to break the second part of my fall. 	With the Ladyboy’s right shoe still in my hand, I hit the road outside with a thump and for the moment wondered how the fuck that had just happened as a crowd of gay guys watched on. Then Steve arrived, his face all in a fluster and helping me to my feet, said.	“Stop fucking about, we need to go quick.”
