Chapter Five           	     We picked a place on the beach in Bang Saphan away from the main town. The area quiet and rich in coconut groves. Rows and rows of seasoned palms reaching up to the sky. Each coveting their plush and heavy load of seeds. Workers drifting about with their small teams of trained monkeys who sat quietly in the side cars of their motorbikes. Each one waiting excitedly for the next opportunity to be let free to climb the towering palms and drop the harvest down to earth.  	“So this is where she’s from eh?” I asked Steve as he peeled himself from the front of the car. 	“So she said.”	“you think her dad did this shit, you think he had himself a monkey team?” I asked as we passed another worker with his small team of primates looking like little people as they sat on the edge of the side car. Carrying and not waiting for Steve to answer and despite the fact I was in the full knowledge that my brother was correct. I said,	“Maybe she was full of shit?”  	“No - She’s from here - I know it. The women here look different from the ones up north. They got different noses.” 	“Is that right?”	“Yeah.” Steve answered, nodding. “Their noses are different. I been looking. You just got to look at that Pimmy girl and you can see.” Laughing I said.	“One stop off at 7–11 and now you an anthropologist?” Not bothering to answer, Steve walked towards the small beach hut I’d just paid for in cash. The accommodation situated right on the beach, with its nice verandah and stairs that dropped down onto the sand. He looked to the sea with its waves lapping the beach.	“If there’s a tsunami, we’re fucked.”	“If?” I answered as I looked out at the ocean.“Yeah if,” Steve said as he opened the door, and quickly laid claim to the bed, dropping himself down onto the crib nearest the water. “If there’s one tonight. Don’t worry, I’ll be first to go.” 						****************      About an hour later, just as the sun was dropping in the west I walked the beach. My big work boots squeezing the soft sand with every step. The salt water lapping against their soles. I looked along the large stretch of golden sand which was for that moment mine and mine alone.       The seemingly endless breeze cooling me as it swayed. The tall palms stretching towards the water, waiting to shed their seed to the ocean. Tiny birds, running for stranded morsels of food left by the retreating tide. In the distance a bunch of dogs stood as they saw me approach. This man who was walking toward them in his cut-off jeans and big boots. This man who had no right to lay bare a claim to a beach and shoreline which was a territory they believed to be theirs and theirs alone. This one tiniest slivered section of a paradise which extended out and beyond the weather beaten picket fence bordering the garden of the dogs owners home and was public domain.       There were five in total, three Pit Bulls, one light brown, the other two black, a Thai street dog and a lovely happy Beagle with not a care in the world. The dogs leaving the beagle to just smile as they approached me as I came towards them. Their backs raised as the street dog began a ritual of incessant barking. The pit bulls simply waiting as if readied for my attack. The beagle watching seemingly just happy to be alive.        By the time I’d reached them I’d instinctively drifted out onto a sand bar as the dogs taking my retreat as a sign of weakness rushed through the shallow water with their legs and undersides splashing as they came. They hit the sandbank, and whipping around me I quickly found myself surrounded. The black Pitbull’s, now they were closer looking older than the lighter brown one with its nasty beady eyes as it skirted about on the sand. The fucking thing nipping at my ankles whilst other two waited and the street dog just barked. Kicking out with my right leg the brown dog jumped narrowly missing my heavy size elevens as they swung through the hot air. The dogs growling as they moved, circling me, as I continued to walk. The brown Pitbull becoming progressively braver and braver with every snap and snarl until with a twist of it’s body it connected. Sinking it’s teeth deep into the leather of my boot. The dog snarling and shaking it’s head as though it had caught a rat by the throat. Planting my right foot back down hard into the sand I bought my left up into the biting dogs ribs, sending it’s body for the moment airborne as the animal held on.       With my eye on the other two dogs as they grew closer, the brown dog, now winded from a second kick to the ribs, the quickly delivered smack to the chest from my left boot making the dog let go. The street dog jumping from side to side as it yapped spinning itself quickly away as the brown dog rolled past. I looked around me.            What I needed was a stick and a big one at that,But there were no sticks, conveniently washed up close by that I could Rambo off the ground and create my own havoc with. It was just me and me alone and what I really needed was not to be there at all.       Glad that it had only been my boot that the dog had bitten onto and not my barefoot, I moved on. Both myself and the dogs it seemed rattled from the foray. Breathing hard and watching my back, I ventured further along the sandy shore line. The palms standing proud at the beaches edge. Some stretching their necks towards the turquoise sea. It was there that I saw it in the distance just standing alone in the sand. The little puppy maybe just six weeks old looking lost as it cried. Reaching it, I sank down resting my ass on the heel of my size eleven boots and called for the little mutt to join me. Nervously the poor thing dropped back and cautiously stared as it span around and around in no doubt the hope that it’s mother would miraculously appear. Then as the never ending tide washed up upon the pure white sand, one wave freak in nature, born of a storm far out in the South China sea perhaps days before came sweeping in catching the little fella and taking him off his feet. Bowling him along the beaches sloping sand, his head under water and his paws kicking out at nothing. Then as quick as the wave pulled back out to sea another wave returned, the ocean dragging the puppy to and fro in the water with it’s never ending cycle of white bubbling foam.        Running into the water with the waves hitting my ass and soaking my jeans I leant down, scooping the little fella up as it instinctively tried to keep its head above water and rolled around in the surf. I looked down to the puppy. It’s frightened eyes, big and bulging as it gazed back at me. The young dogs fur pulled tight to its tiny body by the salt laden water. Smiling, I said to it as it stared back at me in terror.       “hello little fella, what you doing here?”                  				***************                  With the puppy still in tow and once again dodging the dogs, I made it back to the cabin by the water. The little dog now my friend for life as it lapped thirstily at the water and milk I’d poured into a dish that was solely meant for humans. He really was a lovely ‘little fella,’ so that’s what I named him. This beautiful happy little pup with its doughy eyes and soft nature. The puppy pulling on the laces of my still wet boots as it played. The little fella jumping for sticks I held just out of reach in my hands. The little fella now happily sleeping on my lap without a care in the world. Then Steve came home with a flea in his ear about something.       “There’s a dead dog up the beach.” Was all he said as he walked right passed me. The little fella still sleeping on my lap as I sat with my feet up on the bench swing that sat outside the door.       “Really?” I replied. “Yeah it’s in the water, surfs got it now though I’d say.” Then he saw the puppy laying there oblivious to the world on my lap.       “Where the fuck you find that?”      “It’s lost,” was all I answered,       “Well, unlost it then, go find it’s mum.”      “Maybe it’s mum is the dead dog you see floating out there.” Walking over, Steve stopped and looked at the puppy laying asleep on my lap.       “Maybe?” he answered, then said, “see I did you a favour in the end, you thought you come out here to rescue me and you ended up rescuing some little mutt instead.”       “Little fella’s his name.” I said correcting him quickly so as little mutt would never get the opportunity to stick.       “Well you better go out there and see for real if that dead dogs got milk titties so as you aint taking the mutt from its mum.” But there was no point in doing that as I already knew what dog it was floating out there on the surf. As I was the one who had killed it.             				*************            With the little fella drenched and still scrambling in my arms I’d turned and seen the brown Pitbull standing with his yappy street dog buddy in tow. The Pitbull staring at me from along the beach.       Ignoring the two dogs I’d sat down in the sand, cradling the little fella in my arms, as it struggled and coughed. It’s little claws scratching at the skin on my legs. His little white teeth biting at my fingers. Then the two dogs had come racing in with all their might, as I’d stood and held the little fella from their viciousness. The two dogs arriving with passion, skidding with their paws digging small channels in the sand. The street dog yapping excitedly, the young brown Pitbull moving around and around me as I walked back along the beach, it’s little beady eyes now only focused solely on taking the little puppy from my arms.       Then as I neared the dogs home it became bolder and had begun to jump. It’s strong ferocious teeth snapping as I’d turned away pushing the dog back with my hips. Hitting the sand the dog moved around to my front and again jumped, it’s front paws scratching my thighs as it came. With another blow from my size elevens I’d sent it rolling away as the dogs back hit the sand. The dog quickly twisting its body, getting to its feet, as it came again. The vicious mutt  possessed with some demonic need as it circled me over and over, until it struck once more. With a free hand I’d let a fist fly catching the monster in the side of its head and caught it with another boot to the ribs as it fell away. Then as soon as it hit the ground it was up again, snarling and jumping unrelentingly as it snapped at my legs and midriff whilst I held the puppy away. I’d moved myself towards the ocean, the waves hitting the back of my calves as the dogs splashed around me. The street dog just yapping as it whipped back and forth. The brown Pitbull continuing to attack. I’d stepped back again, until the waves hit my knees, the Pitbull charging forward snapping at my legs and feet as I held the puppy away from its snapping jaw and kicked back in defence. Then the dog dropped down, and with a surge of pure rage sprang at me through the water, biting down the top of my hip as I span away to protect myself. The dog this time getting purchase with its jaw and teeth, clamping it’s self into my cut down jeans and clasping it’s front incisors into the flesh on my hip. Falling back I hit the water. The waves now smashing around above my head. With one hand I held the little fella out of the surf as my other grabbed the ruff of the Pitbull’s neck and held it there under the water as I fell. With both legs wrapped around the dogs torso and the other holding firm onto the dogs neck I felt it let go it’s grip to my side and unable to breathe began to kick and struggle in the surf stirring up the sand on the oceans shallow bed until eventually it went still.                 				**************      “No either way I think I’ll keep it.” I said, already having made up my mind after having saved the little fella’s life twice that morning I felt it was fate for us both to meet.       “How? You can’t keep it here, they don’t do pets.” Steve protested in a manner that any one hearing him would assume he was an authority on hotel policy in the area.       “He’s not a pet - he’s a puppy.”       “You gonna take him back to Canada then?”      “Absolutely.” I answered even though with regard planning the dogs future, in truth, I hadn’t got much further than a bowl of milk. 					*************      With my new found companion we hit the road again. The little fella tucked up on my lap as I took our new noisy car with its itchy seats and supercharged engine out onto the highway. Steve there looking down at my boots as my feet danced on the pedals whilst I switched gears. Me feeling the bruise from the dog bite on my hip with every thrust of my foot.      “I reckon you killed that dog.” Steve then said.      “What dog?” I asked doing my best to sound confused.      “You know.”      “Why’d you say that?” I then asked still trying to sound surprised as I looked to my brother and then down at the little fella on my lap.       “Just know what you’re like, that’s all. That and the fact you got teeth marks in those wet boots you always wearing and there’s scratches on your legs and there’s something up with your hip.”      “You a pet detective? One of them RSPCA gumshoe investigator guys now are you?” I asked him as I shifted lanes dropping behind a truck which once again seemed to be carrying twice the load it was designed for. Steve saying,      “Somethings not right, I know that. You going to be getting us in trouble out here carrying on with your shit like you do.”       “I never touched that dog, for fuck sake!” I answered  “The dog probably just drowned or something.”       “How you know it drowned?” He snapped back.       “Well, for one, you said it was in the water on a beach! So forgive me for assuming. It’s not like he would have been hit by a fucking car is it?”       “How do you know it was a male dog.”      “I don’t.” I answered back in a deniability tone I’d perfected ever since I’d began killing insects as a kid. Then in silence we sat for a bit. Myself looking to the road trying to stay alive. Steve looking to the little fella. Unable to stop myself I simply said.       “Maybe you spend as much time looking at the games and moves that chick was playing as you have working out the final moments of some fuckhead dog then the vicious fucker would never have got itself drowned?”       “So you did kill it? You fuck!” Steve snapped back at me in somewhat surprise. And being completely and utterly honest I told him the truth.      	“No.”             				***************      About an hour later and fully fed on gas station market chicken and milk for the pup, we hit traffic. The car moving noisily along the highway until things slowed and I down shifted to a crawl behind a procession of cars which crept forward towards a police check. The motorcade of vehicles one after an another slowing as they filed into a single line only to be stopped long enough for the police men in their tight brown uniforms to lean down, look inside, and wave the car forward.        “Maybe they looking for bad guys.” Steve said as he watched the police release car after car after car until they eventually came to us, but they weren’t looking for bad guys, they were looking for us.             				****************       	I sat in a hot and stuffy police station with it’s inadequate air conditioning. The palms outside swaying in the breeze. A police man in his starched tight brown uniform emblazed with decorative ribbon sown into his shirt just above his heart stood now before me. The man wandering about the room squawking bad English that genuinely made little sense. Saying words such as “Papers? Passport? Hotel? Visa?” Along with a host of other shit I’d long given up trying to understand. It had to be about the guy who’d killed himself accidently falling out the window back in Pattaya. And no doubt the police in charge up there in Pattaya where wanting answers. So knowing only too well most people sitting in prison put themselves there, I simply said again for what must have been the fifth time.       “Where’s puppy, puppy needs his milk?”      “Puppieeeee….. Pupieeeee….Gin…. Gin…. No worryyyy… ” The man replied as he walked back and forth in the small room, his boots gleaming with shine, the chromed metal kick plates on the inside of each heal catching the sun beaming it’s rays onto the floor.        Just as the fourth hour passed I finished another water and wondered if they had Steve sitting there sweating in another room also. And if so whether they were stupid enough to think that he was about to start blabbing. Then the door opened and another man came in, placed both hands in front of himself ‘wayed’ me and then sat down on the other side of the desk.       His name was Soone. Soone Jungumang to be exact, and it turned out he’d driven all the way from Pattaya just to speak with me.       “What makes me so special for you to have you come all the way down here to see me?” I asked, as I sat there staring at the man as he sat opposite. The man looking fly, with his fresh haircut and designer clothes. In perfect English he replied. 	“Oh, it’s my penance for studying so hard at university. Now whenever there’s someone of interest, guess who gets the call?”       He was Tourist Police. The worst type of cop, I’m told. But from what I had seen so far, the guy didn’t seem so bad. Maybe it was his way, maybe he was the ‘good’ in the good cop bad cop scenario, and he had a not so clean cut miserable fuck of a buddy waiting in the hall. I asked, getting straight to the point. 	“Is this the norm for tourists who are trying to enjoy their stay in your country?” 	“Depends if they’ve been on a killing spree I suppose, but no, not normally. Just people around here tend to get a little sensitive about their pets.”            Oh! So that was it. It wasn’t about the loser who’d accidently fallen out of the window of some brothel, it was all about a fucking vicious dog which should have learned to swim. Without batting an eye, I replied,       “What the fuck you talking about?” And Soone Jungumang replied.	“There’s a nice Canadian man lives on the water with his family - spent some money on some pure breed dogs, everyone in the family got to pick their favourite I’m told. Turns out his favourite drowned.	      “Is that right?” I asked. 	“Apparently.”	“And when was this supposed to have happened?.”	“This morning.”	“You come all the way down from Bangkok because some dog can’t swim?”	“Pattaya actually, and… No.”	“Then what the fuck you talking about?”	“This German man is saying you drowned it. Said it was just playing and you kicked it and dragged the poor little thing into the ocean?” I gave that one some thought. Playing, really…. playing? The poor little thing - Tell that to the bite mark on my thigh. So I answered,       “Go tell that to the guy who did it because it wasn’t me. Maybe when you find him he’ll fess up to the other dozen dead dogs I saw laying in the kerb on the way down here.” 	“So you’re saying it wasn’t you?” 	“Your English is pretty good?” I answered. And the man’s English was good, as good as mine I have to say. And there was no reason it shouldn’t have been considering Soone Jungumang had been brought up by a British step father who’d met his mother whilst teaching English at a school in Bangkok and decided to stay. He said,       “The man’s saying he watched you do it, along with other witnesses.”	“Oh really?”	“Yes.”	“Well, all us white guys look the same I’m told.”	“Not like you they don’t…. You were staying at a hotel on the beach?”	“Yes but who knows if it was the same beach this dog discovered it could not swim.”	“And the guy who killed the dog had a puppy, and you’ve got a puppy?”	“So’s my mum, but she didn’t drown the dog either.”Soone then walked to the other side of the room and stared out of the window as though there was something else on his mind. Turning back he said. 	“Your brother has told us it was you.” That one I laughed openly about. Fuck me, good luck with that. This guy was going to have to try harder. How many times throughout my life so far had some prick, be it school teachers, headmasters, cops, or any other fucker who’d believed they had the chops to get in between my brother and myself. Even if he was an idiot, only to find out in the end they’d failed. I said. 	“Is that right?”	“No, not exactly. But he did just swap your car for a bottle of water so as you both could get on your way.”       With that, I sat there just stunned.             He’d done what?             And that is exactly what I said. The Thai tourist policeman who spoke perfect English, saying back with a smile.	“Yeah he said he was thirsty and I’m a sucker for hot rod Civics you know. Shame for you your brother isn’t, says the seats make his back itch.”      I sat there for a moment taking it all in. What the fuck had that stupid fuck Steve done now? Why the fuck would he do that? Fuck!Okay, so the shit head dog problem was solved, but there may not have been a problem anyway had he just kept quiet. Then Soone Jungumang said as he stood there with a big stupid grin across his face. 	“So you can either go hire one if you want from in town, or buy yourself another from a dealer, either way you’ll be needing new wheels so you can get on your way. But before I let you go you need to tell me about that guy you threw out the window in Pattaya.”
