And due to this somewhat recent inability to govern my tongue, I would soon be missing my front teeth, along with a couple of molars on the right-hand side of my jaw.       Now, when I say I cannot keep my mouth shut, the problem isn’t as serious as, let’s say, Tourette’s. Not at all. It isn’t. I’m not shouting ‘root my old granny’ in the library and twitching or anything like that. I’m saying, the problem I’ve developed was that these days it seemed I simply had no filter. And if someone needed to be called a ‘lazy fat cunt’ or an ‘inconsiderate prick’ or whatever was appropriate at any particular given moment. I would say exactly what was on my mind. Plain and simple. Good or bad. Right or wrong. They would be told. Regardless of whether I wanted to or not.       Hence the soon to be missing teeth, but we’ll get to that part later.             For now, though I am sitting in a plane, in economy, on my way to Bangkok. At the back, by the toilets and wishing I’d paid the extra for business. So, as I could be in row one, or maybe even in row twenty one, in premium. But no, I am not. I’m at the back - by the shitters. Next to some loser sitting beside me who’s been making love to a Kit-kat bar whilst I listen to people in the trap behind me, shitting, pissing, wanking, belching, farting, or whatever. And all this, due to my brother.       My brother, Steve, asking for a $7,000 loan that he swore he’d pay back. The man finding himself at the ripe age of twenty-seven, suddenly in love with a Thai girl with remarkably big breasts, and wishing to open a bar. The man telling me, nothing could be better than living the rest of his life in paradise, on some wonderful beach, with the girl of his dreams.       Only the seven grand soon became seventy and the Thai girl with the big titties quickly, surprise, surprise, disappeared.       It happens a lot – so I’d been told more times than I’d care to hear. Listening, every time, as I’d sat with both elbows pressed into some Formica table top in some sterile canteen, built with sturdy decks and even more sturdier benches which fed the ravenous who worked the oil rigs of Northern Alberta. Inconceivable yarns voiced by oil riggers or otherwise, articulating sad romances, spouting tales personal or second hand. All now seemingly expertly knowledgeable, about the honey traps they themselves had admittedly fallen victim to or they had seen inflicted upon other lonely men with lost souls.       Men who’d openly and whole heartedly fallen for a beautiful woman with a nice juicy snatch. Five grand here, two grand there. Apparently, it was the norm. With most guys being hit hard and with pace in some Machiavellian manner or other, as my brother had. Or by a slow drip that lasted until the money run out or the poor soul died. Or both.       There are of course the oil workers I’d spent years working with who knew and understood the game, which obviously my brother didn’t. These guys who lived a solitary life, earning a fortune on a four-month shift. Taking their grungy rough hands and dirty bear like hairy backs first class into Suvarnabhumi airport as per their contract. Big oily fucks, sitting squashed in their expensive little pods for seventeen hours like a rat in a pipe. Looking as out of place as a banana in a fish shop. Gruesome beasts, off to blow all their money and play millionaire king for a month, in heat that could melt a brick. Some meeting their holiday wives at the airport. Others, renting one from a special bar close by, much the same as they would a car when they arrived.      Myself though now sitting at the back, having already spent more than any of them and deprived of any endless honeymoon period blowies that would have preceded the inevitable train wreck these beautiful young ladies exacted upon these men who should know better.  Sitting at the rear, still in my work boots and jeans. My knees pressed hard into the seat in front. Right next to the shitter door that was banging every five minutes. The guy next to me unravelling his KitKat bar every ten. Each time pulling back the plastic silvery foil from the brown chocolate wafer. The man taking a minuscule sliver of a bite, scraping the chocolate away carefully with his front teeth. The man getting more satisfaction out of such a simple act of eating a chocolate wafer than I’ve ever seen another human achieve in my life.       The guy telling me in between bites that his girl in Pattaya wasn’t like the rest. Telling me how she’d never scammed him, the way my brother had been scammed. Bragging about how she was honest and pure and had never worked in a bar. The stupid fuck, with his freshly manicured fingers going on and on about his Cinderella dream girl and how they were going to marry. The man taking tiny little, itsy-bitsy bites from his chocolate bar over and over as he spoke until I could take it no more, and screamed out saying…       “Just eat the fucking thing!” It was going to be a long flight.Chapter Two:      With the thoughts of ramming chocolate bars down a man’s throat still lingering, the oven like heat struck me hard as I stepped off the airconditioned plane. The humidity hitting me harder as I stepped out the cab in Pattaya and took a room in a four-star hotel that should have been three.       Fuck it was hot, I thought. Hotter than Grande Prairie Northern Alberta in August it seemed, without the bugs though. Not that they weren’t around, they were. I’d seen a few. But here they didn’t come in gangs of what at times seemed like a thousand. Here they were like little Ninja’s, slipping across the ground as they came for your calves and ankles. Tiny efficient warriors with escape capabilities that would make Tom Cruise sit up and listen.       And the women, wow, my goodness, the women. Now I could see the attraction this place held for the lost and the lonely, and all those grubby fucks I’d spent so many years in the company of who came here. Pretty girls in every direction, wherever I went. Bars and massage parlors full of smiling faces. Spouting deception as they told the ugliest of men how handsome they really were. Hotels loaded with beaming girls tucked away behind the front desk welcoming you home. Shops, cafes and restaurants bursting at the seams with gorgeousness in every direction I went.       I walked out to the foyer of the hotel, smiled at the three young ladies behind the desk. Then I took a left, dodged the motorbikes and headed down to the beach. With a breeze in my face, I sat myself down on a bench and looked out to sea. The turquoise blue ocean my brother Steve had described looking a dark muddy green in the cloud covered sky. The white sand leading out before me disappearing under the waves as they rolled in from across the gulf. Palms lining the sea-walk as far as the eye could see. Western men, well past their sell by date, with their white pasty skin, wearing sandals or crocs and wife beater shirts. All waiting to die as they sat under umbrellas, drinking beer with their holiday wives and fat guts. Korean men looking fly in their freshly pressed Lacoste’s avoiding the groups of Indian men, a dozen strong, too scared to leave each-others side looking like rape gangs searching for victims as they patrolled the roadside. Thai men and women with their little food carts. Cars and motorbikes filing past that never seemed to end, filtering out the constant din coming from the bars that lined the other side of the street. Each competing for the loose coins ready to be shed by the stream of westerners from all walks of life who had drifted into town.        ‘Fuck me’ I thought, as I looked about the place. How the fuck am I going to find anyone here in this zoo?      I pulled out my phone and opened a photo of my brother sitting at a bar with his new ‘girl.’ Steve, or Steven as our mother liked to call him. The young man a younger version of myself I suppose sitting red faced with an even younger big breasted Thai beauty who was undoubtedly out of his league.       Then I looked around to the wives or girlfriends of the sad men that sat at the beach basking in the heat around me. Not one wasn’t punching above his weight as they say. Maybe it really was just the way things were here? I thought. I can’t say I hadn’t heard all about it before.       I looked back down to the phone and zoomed in on the girls’ face, studying her features. She had long dark hair, flattish nose, nice lips, not overly made up. Extremely pretty. Then I slid my stupid brother into frame,      “Yeah, I can see you falling for that, you dumb fuck.” I said out loud as I looked to the photo’s background and through the windows to the outside. Palm trees lit from below sat across the street. The trees above me not too dissimilar. Maybe? I thought, maybe? 	I zoomed in on the drinks sitting at the table and the food. It all looked good, delicious in fact. Then I thought back to the sandwiches and shitty food I’d been eating on my journey out here and the frugal approach I always seemed to take for myself with regard money. With myself eating bread, yet happy to give to others. My brother being a prime example. The prick living it up the way he had been it seemed. The young man playing the rich guy, acting big, and knowing everything was all being paid for by me.       “Stupid - Cunt!” I shouted out loud unable to control myself. Stupid cunt, not being what I particularly wanted to say, but what came out instead. My unusual uncontrollable inner voice spitting out as I’d stared at the phone. My big mouth, gaining the displeasure of the man in his wife beater shirt sitting next to his pretty woman a few feet away. The man from what I’d seen so far spending his afternoon drinking beer and looking at other women. His wife sitting bored in her high heels on the beach. The man now taking off his sunglasses and staring, looking to me, catching my eye and holding it for a moment.       So, I stared back at him. This guy, unshaven, with his fat gut, disrespecting his girlfriend or wife who looked as though she’d once been a whore. Myself saying out loud as I did.      “Fat cunt.” What the fuck was this place, a human zoo?  I thought, as I looked away and across the road to the bars with their blaring music loaded with men in the autumn of their lives.       The city being nothing like Steve had described it. A weird menagerie. A mecca built for drunks and lonely men, and any locals who saw fit to live off of them as they kept them fed and watered. Maybe I’d just got off at the wrong stop, taken a hotel in the wrong part of town? I wondered. But I hadn’t and I wasn’t in the wrong part of town. This was it. This was Pattaya, a destination of sleazy streets and bars full of hookers and predators alike.       Now, I don’t want you to get this wrong. My brother had not actually stolen from me. The young man being nothing but open and honest to a certain degree about anything and everything - only for the fact that to myself, from what I could see so far, he had possibly exaggerated his version of paradise. Maybe after working on and off the oil rigs and getting his dick sucked by coked out hookers with bad skin and little teeth in Grand Prairie every three weeks possibly made this place appear like paradise?       Who knows? 	There was one thing I did know for certain though, now I had found myself in a place that for some it seemed like to call paradise, someone either here or somewhere in this country was walking about with my money, and I was not leaving until I got it back. My brother had called me, and I’d listened as my hands quickly froze in the bitter Albertan windwhilst he’d told me how he was in love with this beautiful girl. Asking me for $7000 which I’d left with my mother to send, who’d then sent over $70,000 by mistake. But what is one zero between family. Mistakes happen and with what the woman was going through, it would have been wrong to get upset. But what should’ve happened is Steve in all his wisdom should’ve sent $63,000 straight back. But Steve being Steve hadn’t. So instead of losing $7000 I lost $70,000. Live and learn they say, and I’d certainly learnt.       I looked back. The man with his wife, beater shirt, and his sunglasses now on the back of his bald head was still staring. The guy openly offended after being told the truth. My irrepressible words obviously digging deep. Opening a wound some would define as reality.      Most people finding themselves unlucky enough to end up with me in their presence, seem to quickly work out that I have a neurological issue. They can see in my face or just hear in my voice that the words I say are not intentional. Some others, like this guy, just don’t. And because of this the decent thing was always to in some manner apologize. So, with every intention of doing that I looked to the man and as I stood and decided it was time to go. I said,      “Fucking loser.” The man saying as I did.      “you’re lucky you’re walking,”But the truth being, with the way I was and the way I knew I could be - it was him who was the lucky one.					  ************      I walked along beach road, towards walking street. Nothing really changing, noisy bars hosting drunk guys sitting there since 11 o’clock in the morning. Some with girls, some without, some still looking. The heat sticking my clothes to my skin. Music blaring for miles as I walked and looked at each soi or laneway as they’re better known in the western world.       Somewhere out, there was a bar that through the windows you could see palm trees and the beach with the ocean in the background. Now, some would say that to find a bar in a coastal town that had built its reputation on drinking and fucking, and not necessarily in that order, then that was going to be like finding a needle in a haystack. And it would’ve been, had it not been for the red tabletops in the establishment where the photo had been taken.       As the afternoon came to close out and the sun began to drop from the sky, I sat at the same table matching the one on my phone. The stall now absent of this beautiful girl and my stupid brother who’d just lost a shit load of cash he should never have had in the first place.       I showed the picture to the girl behind the bar and the waitress. Neither showing any recollection at all. The girls suitably good liars, or just blocking out every loser and his newfound princess that came through the door. I’d found this place, for all the good it had done me and now what I needed to do was find the bar that I was supposedly going to buy. Steve’s hotel, not being hard to find at all as it was the same one, I was staying in.       I knew the place, because he’d face timed me by the pool, which must have been around the time he was racking up the huge room service bill which an irate manager had told me about after I’d enquired as to whether he was still residing there? Which he wasn’t. But he was somewhere, I could just feel it.       By the time night had fallen, in what felt like the same amount of time it had taken Buddha to flick some imaginary switch, I’d covered what I believed to be the town. Then I’d hit walking street with its endless bars and noise and supply of women to match. Exhausted I sat myself down in a bar opposite a club to watch the world go by with my first beer in hand.       One thing was for certain, if I stayed here long enough Steve was going to come cruising past. He had to it seemed, as the rest of Pattaya pretty much had. In fact, two of the guys, I’d seen on the plane had already, along with my kitkat eating friend with his virgin bride who by the looks of her was nothing of the sort.	One beer became two and the fifth slowly followed as the world past me by. Everyone was here it seemed, in this circus of a town, this adult Disneyland. Girls in high heeled shoes that fitted, most that did not. Legs, asses and titties by the thousand. Girls that were having fun, others that were not. Long hair, short hair, red hair, blonde hair, curly hair, no hair, men dressed as women, women that looked like men. Music bars, executive bars, Go Go bars, blow job bars, Russian women bars, massage shops, soapy massage shops, oily massage shops, freelance hookers, pissed off burnt white skinned wives with their emasculated beaten husbands. Horny mums with horny dads, Arabs dressed in long white robes, Koreans dressed for golf, Japanese businessmen in nicely ironed suits. Perverted German men, losers, oddities, lowlifes, sexual predators, more gangs of Indian’s searching for a discounted five on one special gangbang - and myself. Still wearing the boots I’d had on back in Alberta which felt now as hot and sweaty as the rest of me. Myself who in this sea of skirt was yet to talk to a woman.       Myself sitting there waiting and knowing that Steve would at some point find the compulsion to hit the club opposite, and dance alone in the middle of the floor. The way he always had when it all became too much. The young man on the dance floor, in amongst the girls, over and over. Steve with his ‘hands in the air like he just don’t care.’ Me on the side lines, wondering why I was born without this sense of rhythm the boy possessed. Wishing I could just let go the same way he did, me, loving the guy, as I watched, like I loved no other in this world.       Of course, there were my parents - I hear you thinking. And yeah, there was mum and dad. Dad who’d played it tough hiding behind his own Jujitsu and Aikido skills and whatever other martial art he could force down our throats from the moment we could walk to the day he’d killed himself after his boyfriend stepped into our world and announced to us all their love.       My mother now still in shock, and I doubt she will ever be the same. Not that any of us in the family would be either. Steve drinking just that little bit more than my mother, or maybe a little bit less. Both of them unable to cope with myself, the elder son who was now incapable of controlling his words.       This man who was me, who had suddenly become the man of the house, who would say it as it was regardless.             				***********      	      It wasn’t until 7am the next morning when I began to relax. Knowing Steve had never gotten up before 10am in his life when he did not have to work. I’d had breakfast and afterward bathed in the plush hotels pool that Steve had probably pissed in before he’d fucked off and stiffed the bill.       The morning sun hitting my back as I swam in my light-colored boxers, wondering if now that they were wet my ass would be transparent, and if any of the staff could see. The water cool on my body as the air filled with moisture. The earth heating up beneath the sun’s rays. In the background birds chirping as they called and sang their morning songs. The outside city now projecting its silence as the breeze from the ocean found its way into the garden and across the pool. Rolling over I laid there on my back in the water, feeling the heat of the sun radiate the moist skin on my face as I stared up into the endless blue of the sky above me.  	By 10am I was back. Back in the world of bars. Watching grown men as they sat and drank openly and alone, staring with contemplation into their pints. Their liquid breakfasts half drunk. Their ‘long time’ hooker girlfriends still back at some hotel shitty or otherwise, sleeping off another night of booze and chemically enhanced sex. The aging men sitting like conquering heroes with their bad backs and aching balls. 	I hit the beach and looked at the waves as they drifted in. If Steve was up before midday, the kid would never be able to resist the surf and he’d be in the water now. Even if it was for just ten minutes. But for as far as my eyes could see, no one was swimming. I then looked further to the islands a few miles out. There was a chance he was holed up there, laying back in some $10 a night beach hut. But I doubted that, not if someone had stolen his cash. It was the way he was or maybe I should say, the way we both were. But why the silence, why had he gone to ground after the call to let me know he’d been had? Was he embarrassed? Undoubtably, who wouldn’t be? But for as much as an idiot he was, we were still a team. He’d been caught in a honey trap, that’s all - and shit happens. How you deal with it after is what counts. Going to the cops was probably a waste and not the way moving forward; he’d know that. Especially here. 	What he’d do would be what I was doing now, tracking whoever was responsible down. Until the poor persons either gave it back or paid it back in other ways. How he dealt with them if and when he found them, now that would be the issue, and whether he had it in him to take things to the next level needed, I was not sure.       This would not be the first time he’d been ripped off. It had happened before, and he’d not handled that well. Now he’d be hating himself for allowing it to happen again a second time.      The prior incident had occurred after he’d built six solid 20ft x 30ft sections of a temporary wooden track to be used in lining the road which led to a camp in the northern Alberta tar sands oil industry. Some guy had stolen them all straight after the first trucks that had carefully crossed them, and the man had found out the hard way what happened when you messed with anyone close to me.       The guy lying dead from a heart attack with his right arm pulled from its socket under one of the heavy wooden track sections Steve had built from scratch. The people out there searching for him, driving over his body day by day as they travelled up and down the makeshift road that he now lay beneath.       Many in the camp thinking it must have been Steve that had dumped him there when the camp rolled on and they’d pulled up the road at the end of the summer. But it wasn’t, I knew that, because it was me.       The man who was now so deservedly dead telling Steve “not to worry and to trust him” six months earlier. My brother doing just that and leaving the six wooden sections of road with him for the man to put to work. The man then later when payment was due denying that the deal had ever happened at all, asking for proof and for the contract papers he’d told Steve he didn’t need because it was a deal built on trust.       No police had been bought in back then, or lawsuits filed, or a big scene made at the camp. Just a cold and heavy wet grave which the man had built for himself with his deceit.       Had there been a murder committed, they could not tell. The question was though, how had the man who was dead from a heart attack ended up under his own road with his arm removed from its socket? That was the big question that needed answering. Then out of the blue as the oil management team scratched their heads and looked to the RCMP for answers, Arthur Mekes, an old boy just nearing retirement had out of the blue happily confessed to a murder he did not commit. 	All the work I’d done in planning and securing an alibi should things get nasty as they had that night back then in the spring many years before, made for nothing a week after the man was found. For Arthur Mekes, after some careful consideration had instead of taking a work truck that he was supposed to use to deliver fuel, instead had delivered himself to the nearest RCMP station and confessed to torturing and killing a man who had other than to stiff someone who he considered a friend, never once done him wrong. The man trading his bed surrounded by thugs and losers in an Albertan oil camp with three meals a day - for a bed surrounded by thugs and losers in Alberta’s Edmonton Institution with three meals a day. Steve seemingly believing the man’s story and that he’d murdered the man in retaliation for the slight he’d made upon his friend and never knowing it was me. 	A year later when the dust had settled and the world had moved on from the man who was found in the frozen mud, I took a trip to see Arthur Mekes to ask him why. The man sitting comfortable in his prison clothes and soft shoes. The man smiling as he’d told me of his retirement plan and how he’d been worried about his old age. Worried about where he’d go once, they’d forced him out of a camp. Worried about the thought of sitting in a world full of geriatrics once he was then forced into a home.       “He was happy,” he’d said, that he’d saved my brothers life and how he’d known the minute he went missing that Steve had killed him, and the moment they’d found the body what he wanted to do. So, I told him,      “If I could tell you that I could prove your innocence, along with Steve’s also, would you let me.”       And as the man had looked at me with his dark and tired eyes, he’d just smiled, as he’d then understood that it had not been Steve who had ended this cockroach’s life, but myself. Who in the freezing cold of night had dumped the body beneath the wooden road deck.       “Thank you for your offer.” Arthur Mekes had said as he’d looked back at me through his sagging watery eyes. His hair now thin, combed back across his head in perfect lines. “A brother of Steven is a brother of mine son. I have friends here and food and medical, dental, and more books than I’m able to read before I die.” Then in a room full of wives and children, family and friends, I’d felt the thin skin of his worn-out hands as Arthur Mekes had taken my hand and said,      “Go have a good life Sandy Childs. Both you and your brother - have a good life.”     	But that was then and now it wasn’t minus 35 in the oil sands, it was plus 35 and the sand was a different kind altogether. And yes, Sandy is my name, Sandy Childs. The older brother to Steve, son of Sal and Shirley. A family full of S’s. A family destroyed by a father who could not admit to the world who he really was. Sandy Childs, thirty-five years of age, oil rig, tar sands consultant, Jiujitsu master, Aikido master, boxer, murderer. Now turned private investigator in a tropical country I knew nothing off, where I now searched for my dumb fuck of a brother and the money he’d lost. 					***********      As the sun became hotter and the coconut juice, I’d purchased became nothing more than a dribble at the bottom of a cheap plastic bag, I moved on. Following a similar route as I had the day previous and with newly cut down jeans, the boots I wore in camp slapping down upon the uneven and broken sidewalk as I went. 	Steve wasn’t a day drinker I knew that. The kid sleeping as soon as the flow of alcohol stopped if the sun was still in the sky. With that in mind and armed with his photo, I hit the hotels large and small. Some opulent, some scummy. All full of people who were there primarily for the same thing. The receptionists smiling with the palms of their hands closed together in a waye as they bowed their heads to me. Looking me in the eye as they sent me on my way. No one knowing the girl or my brother, no one helping in my quest.       As the last of the day hung on and the silent dispatcher of jetlagged fatigue tried its best to take a hold of my body I saw her for the first time, and another natural urge took over.       This siren of a girl, in a sea of so many. This wonderful young woman sitting tall and with grace on her brand-new scooter. Her long hair half hidden by a hat, complimenting an outfit that exemplified style. This girl riding with ease through the dirty crowded streets which linked together this den of iniquity. This girl, squeezing her little red colored Vespa in amongst a line of one hundred more motorcycles. The girl then walking through the crowds with her bare legs and brand-new heels. 	With a compulsion I had never in my life felt before, I followed. Knowing what I was doing was in so many ways wrong. Watching this young lady as she walked before me, weaving my way through the crowded streets, amongst a sea of people. The waves of bar music bleeding out upon the street. Ignoring all the invites as I passed every small cluster of badly liveried petite Thai women wearing uncomfortable shoes. Russian women with attitude, tall and skinny with their tight dresses and platform shoes and strangely dyed hair. Happy African women looking strong and curvaceous with their lithe figures and beautiful in their dark russet skin. 	Live bands singing western songs, screaming rehearsed words that to them had no meaning. Modern DJ’s mixing songs which had less. This girl before me holding herself tall and gracious, passing through the smut and sadness. Myself staying untouched by the jeers of the girls calling to me and the gapes of losers as I journeyed through. 	Reaching a restaurant at the end of the street, she made her way inside. The girl smiling as she wayed the Buddhist shrine by the door and then her bosses as well as her friends. The girl disappearing to the rear and reappearing at the door. Standing behind her little desk where she welcomed guests with her smile. 	I watched for a while. Myself lost in a world of marvel come curiosity and for the moment forgetting about my brother.  Go in and meet her you fool. I told myself as I looked down at my boots and the jeans I’d cut down into shorts. I was a mess, I knew that, but less than an hour ago I did not care. So why be bothered now? I thought. Then I saw a man who would bring my newfound worries and concerns back to reality. This man in his wheelchair pushing his way through the crowd with his hard cased folder carrying lottery tickets on his lap. A group of loud and excited young Israeli men cutting him off, making him lose any momentum he’d gained with their self-centred ignorance. The men animated and insensitive in their little group, all without a care for the disabled man’s constant struggle. They reached me, not one oblivious to their boorish actions. Looking to them as they passed, I said. 	“Watch where you’re going you cunts.”The men, hearing me, understanding my words, looking behind them to the man in the wheelchair and then back to myself. The men feeling strong as a group but instinctively knowing their numbers would still not be enough to handle my size should they be brave enough to respond.	I watched them go, the men with their tight shorts and nicely pressed shirts disappearing from view as they became swallowed by the crowd. Then as I looked back to the beautiful girl in the restaurant, I saw the man below me now sitting there in his wheel chair. Smiling up at me with his rotten teeth. Opening the case that lay upon his lap, he showed off the rows of lottery tickets all neatly lined up.	“How much?” I asked. The man saying back. “one ticket - one hundred baht.”  For a moment I stared at him, this man with his worn-out clothes and beaten down skin. The man doing his best to keep his dignity despite living an existence which would have been more difficult than myself or that band of pricks I’d just called cunts could ever comprehend.	      “How much for all of them?” I asked as I stared at the folder and tried to do the math. All the tickets lined up in order, each one showing off its lucky number. Twenty across and fifteen deep. That had to be three hundred total so 30’000 baht, unless they were doubled up. Reaching down I lifted up a ticket to check and seeing it wasn’t, I pulled back another to see the same. Looking back at the man, I said.	“I’ll take them all.”The man not understanding me correctly for the moment and then having no problem as I discreetly pulled the wad of money I’d pulled from the ATM at the airport and placed it in his hand. 	“Forty thousand Baht. That enough?” I asked as the man stared at the money in shock.It was. Pulling the tickets from the case as fast as his worn-out fingers would allow, he handed me a wad-not to dissimilar in size from the currency I’d just given him, then he took my money, throwing it quickly into his now empty chest and with a smile and a quick “thank you.” He was back off into the crowd and gone.  					*********** 	Two and a half hours later I stepped through the door. The happy meeting with a wheelchair bound lotto salesman absent from my mind. All the tickets now gone except one which I handed to this goddess of a girl with a smile as her eyes met mine.       She sat me at a table and my eyes followed her until there was nothing left to see. The girl then coming back and taking my order. Saying sweetly,       “I’m glad you came in. I was getting worried about you standing all alone out there.”Surprised, I stumbled for words, then like a fool, I simply told her the truth.      “I’m looking for my brother.”      “Oh?” She answered in surprise.      “Yeah.”Then she waited, pen in hand for me to elaborate. And I said.       “I don’t know what to get.”      “Take a chance.” I looked some more at the folded menu, without truly looking. The tiredness in me suddenly non-existent. Looking up I said,      “your English is perfect.”      “I try.” The girl replied without another word.I said, “burger and chips.” and the moment the words came out of my mouth I felt like a fool. The beautiful girl telling me to take a chance on a menu with so many dishes that I’m sure were beyond compare, and I’d gone straight to good old basic level one - Fuck! I thought, as then without the slightest judgement she asked,       “Drink?” 	“Beer, please.” Now, I’m not saying I’m a drunk, but I will say that I can drink - and drink myself into oblivion is what I tend to do. Another addition to the complicated life I’d found myself in and one I believe I can thank my late father for.                   				**************            	Not knowing where I was, I woke up as the dawn light blessed the windows of the hotel room which I had called home since I’d arrived. With a swollen head I looked to the pool. My ankles itched from mosquitoes, that had found their way there despite wearing my boots which lay on the floor by the entranceway. Reaching down and scratching the bites until they bled, I tried to remember.       The girl, yes, the girl. The girl in all her beauty on her little red motorbike, giving me her time. The captured smiles from her position at the door as I’d sat eating. Her eyes rarely leaving mine. 	Me waiting in my little booth at her request, beer in hand, as I’d watched her while the hours passed by until her shift was done. And then watching her again as she’d danced in front of me in the club. Our eyes closing as we’d kissed. The smell of her perfume, the taste of her mouth, the feel of her body as with alcohol induced bravado, I’d pulled her too me. 	 But what had happened after? For fuck sake! It was always the same, drink to be happy, drink to be social, drink to oblivion.       I got up and hit the shower, seeing the girl’s hair now around the plug hole, then her lipstick by the sink. Fuck? 	With a towel around my back, I sat down on the bed and racked my brain for a piece of the previous evening. What had I said? Where had we been? Had we fucked? My pickled mind stretching for something another part of me had already obliterated. I looked down at my dick, it was still there. And then it hit me. I’d told her about Steve, as we’d sat there in another bar after the restaurant had closed. Pouring out my troubles to a girl who, in my inebriated state, I believed I’d known forever. Myself talking of Steve in the fashion that could have just as easily been an ex. Myself telling her how I’d wandered around this city, that had at first seemed so big but was actually quite small. Telling her of seeing the losers I’d seen on the plane getting blown in a BJ bar without explaining why I was in there myself.       Fuck, I’d done it again. Found a girl and with my drinking, turned her into Cinderella. What a fucking idiot I was, what was her name? It was a good question. I then thought back to how she’d listened as I’d told her my tale of woe. How I’d spoken to her of how my mother was stupid for not being able to navigate a bank transaction. How stupid my brother was for just saying to me he’d handle it. How I’d sent him the cash in good faith in the first place. Then agreeing with him that he’d be able to sort it out when it had all gone tits up - only for him then to go silent. Fuck me, I thought, how many times had I said the word stupid, when in reality I was the stupid one?      One thing this girl had said I then remembered as we’d sat close in a bar trying not to lose a word said to a band that could not play quietly.       “You only supported someone you love - you did nothing wrong.” True enough in its basic and simplistic form I suppose. But there were a lot of ‘buts’ I could slip in after such a kind statement rolled sweetly from these beautiful lips of a girl who oozed compassion. A girl born from an honest soul. ‘But’ I should have known better and not been a fucking moron – ‘But’ I should have flown here and seen the situation for myself first before I’d wired had the money wired – ‘But’ I should have gone to the bank myself. ‘But’ what was the good in dwelling in the past. I just needed to find my brother. Then I could look at the playing field – even if it did now need resurfacing.       I got dressed, stepped into my big boots and realized I’d missed breakfast. Then skipping my morning swim as penance, I once again smiled to the pretty girls at the reception desk, walked to the beach, sat down beneath an umbrella for the third time, and stared at the ocean.       That girl, oh man, that girl. I thought. Her presence, her essence, still surrounded me - like a peaceful spirit who’d latched onto my back and decided to hang.       Was I going to do it again? I thought some more, as I heard the first of the noisy bars turn on their music. Walk these streets again, sweating, dodging potholes, dodging the motorcycles which whipped past, dodging loser men looking for paid love. Should I visit the same bars? Hear the cat calls, hello mister, hello handsome man…. Do it all once more without even the luxury of a half-hearted massage or getting my dick sucked. The novelty of the place, the noise, the sexy girls with their tiny slim waists of all ages slowly wearing off.       The answer was simple. I was, and I would until I had found Steve.             				**********      So, I began my walk again, sifting through the bars on the main roads and nestled down back alleys. Heard the calls from the maidens. Smiled away the offers of BJ’s given with the simplest of hand gestures to the mouth. Within an hour as the sun poured down from the blue sky above, I found myself standing once again outside the same restaurant I had embarrassed myself with a burger and chips plus my drinking the night before.       The girl wasn’t there. No smiling angel standing behind the greeter’s desk. Inviting me in with eyes which I would know were meant for me and me alone. I moved on, only to find myself back there an hour later.  And then the next hour after.       What was I doing? I wondered, as I stared through the sea of people who wandered without purpose before me. I was becoming like so many of the losers here is what. Guys obsessed with one girl in a land of plenty. Here I was, infatuated after one drunken night in which I couldn’t even remember its end. Loser. That was definitely the correct definition of myself, a guy who should have been in his little office. The one I’d earned for myself in the oil district of Calgary. Switching my office in the evening for an almost as small apartment on the Beltway. A home in which I couldn’t sleep because of the drunken screaming from the cowgirls and cowboys as they made their way home. Stopping as they always seemed to do right below my window. Spouting their drunken bullshit and laughing at nothing at all. Were they really a pain in the ass or was I just jealous that I myself had no life? It was something I’d began to often wonder as I’d put back on my big boots at the weekend so I could feel real again. Myself, wishing I was back on the rigs I’d worked so hard to get away from. Myself, there in Calgary, staying close to my mother who I know after each weekend visit, wished I’d never leave.	But here I was once again in a foreign country watching and listening to people having fun the same as I had in Calgary. Sitting on the fence as the world passed me by. In the guise of finding my elusive brother. Fighting the urge to stand for an age outside that restaurant again, I sat myself down in a bar. Swearing to myself when a beer arrived that it would be only one, and when it arrived, I then settled in to watch the world go by.       Just as I was starting my third my stomach dropped as a ping from my phone told me there was a message. Picking it up and hoping it was my brother, I was then surprised by my sudden sadness as I saw a picture of myself and this stunning girl whose name I did not know from the night before. Her looking beautiful, myself red eyed. Quite the happy couple, enjoying life, in a bar which I have little memory of being in. Under it she simply asked. 	“You found him yet?”I stared at the words as though they had been delivered to me by the messiah himself. Words sent by an angel I suppose. An angel who was interested in me. Without a lot of thought, I answered with purpose.	“not yet!”	And as soon as I did, I wished I’d asked how she was instead. Then before I could do just that, another text arrived. And all it said was,	“Try… BoysTown?”And that’s exactly where I found him.Chapter Three      ‘BoysTown’ a place of mystery, sat hidden away from the world at the end of a small soi and when I eventually found it, I could not believe the zone had escaped me prior as I’d walked the length and breadth of this city.       The whole area a mini gay version of Pattaya snuggled inside the city. Instead of girls standing outside of the bars or dancing half naked on the stages, there were men. The bars loaded with handsome guys mostly of a younger age. Their customers a million miles away from the cargo short pants and wife beater wearing hoards that frequented the rest of the city. Handsomely groomed men of all ages, most completely out and others wishing they could be as they were at that moment no doubt just for this particular trip. Uber gay Thai men with bright underwear showing through thin silk or linen suits wandering the streets.       Steve sitting in amongst the rainbow flag waving hoard and standing out to me like a sore thumb. The kid just staring at a line of dancers in a bar three venues down from where he was sitting. 	      I sat myself down next to him and as he looked up for a second, I saw the minutest glimpse of surprise, then as he looked back towards the dancers in the bar, he heard me say.      “When you going to stop being a complete and utter cunt all your life?”       Steve nodding. As he took that one in. Then he said.  	“you took your time?”Fuck me, I thought. The guy had said over and over how he was going to handle it, and I wasn’t to come. Now he was complaining that I wasn’t quick enough, Steve then said. 	“Mum wants you to call her she’s worried.” Confused, I replied. 	“She tell you I’m looking for you?”	“Yeah.”	“And you didn’t think you should call me or something? Or even get her to tell me where you were?” He didn’t. It was just the way he was I suppose. The guy trying to fix his little issue on his own, no doubt. But wishing I was there with him to help. Then with his eyes still fixed on the bar away from the one he was sitting in, he said. 	“See that guy there with the muscles in the pink undies? Well, he knows where my Sherri is.” His Sherri? I thought. So that was the girls name who’d fleeced him, having either not heard it at all, or simply forgotten it quickly as he’d droned on and on about her prior on the phone. I stared at the Thai man as he danced away gyrating his hips, all covered in oil. The guy smiling at the western men as he waved his ass.	“How do you know that? I asked.	“Because he’s, her brother.”	“You met him?”	“Briefly”   	“Yeah, in the street, he was with his wife and kids.”Confused I shook my head as I took that one in, turned and looked to my brother, then back to the stage. 	“Sorry?”	“Yeah - he’s not gay,”	“He’s not?”	“No – He’s straight, as an arrow, same as us. Does this for a living and drives a cab when no one’s knocking on his rear door, when things here get slow, if you know what I mean.” 	I did.	“And you know this – How?”	“Because I ask questions and I’m not stupid.”      Well, that was to be debated.             I asked,	“If you’ve met him, how do you know he has not seen you?”	“he hasn’t.”	“yeah - but how do you know?”	“Because he told me all us white guys look the same.”I sat back and watched the guy in his pink undies for a moment then looked around. It was certainly a sausage-fest and there was definitely a vast discrepancy in the look of the two of us and the style and expensive neatly cut haircuts of the majority of gay men we sat amongst. I looked down at myself in my freshly cut off jeans and big work boots. Then Steve said,	“You see that guy sitting at the table with grey hair, white shirt and fancy dickie bow tie?” I looked through the crowd to the tables, sifting from one man to the next, until I thought I’d found the person Steve was referring to. 	“Yeah - go on?”	“well, he’s the guy who suggested I buy that bar.”	“And?”	“said it was a good idea.”	“And?”	“well, he was full of shit.”	“And you’re surprised by this?”Steve thought about that one. Then answered me with,	Well, I wasn’t suspicious until I saw him here talking to Sherri’s brother.”	“Sherri?” I asked again, making sure I had the name right.	“Yeah – Sherri - My fiancée, fuck me. How many more times I gotta say it. We were supposed to be getting married tomorrow.”	This came as news to me. 	“What? Like officially married with government stamps and everything?” I asked. “Or you saying like a private bullshit marriage, between you and her without a rubber stamp?”	“Proper - And don’t be getting all pouty faced about it either. We’d have let you and mum know once it was all done. Had a party planned when we got back to Alberta for the both of you.”Thanks for nothing.With my nose put out of joint, and not getting ‘pouty,’ I looked about. A group of roided body builders in muscle shirts sat a table over eyeing up the talent as a collection of masculine ladyboys floated past. Then a skinny man passed by also wearing a tight top, holding hands with his Thai boyfriend. The body builders following him with their eyes. Openly smirking at the young man’s physique, making him feel self-conscious. The stares to the man from these simple-minded bullies ending as they met mine. But any opinion these pricks had on this man I’d never met or ever would was none of my business and had nothing to do with me. So, I looked at them all and said out loud, 	“Fat roided bully cunts!”  Then leaving that out there, I turned back to Steve, and carried on with,       “And you’re a bigger one.” Steve saying straight back without missing a beat,      “Still got that thing then?”Yes, I still had that thing.      Even though Steve had heard it all before, and he was doing his best to ignore it, I could see that one cut deep. But fuck him what could I do. The truth hurt I suppose, and he deserved it. Not inviting myself and mum to his wedding. Not that I’d have gone to this ‘wedding’ that is. Knowing our mother would not want to go without our father and I’d never have left her alone on such a special day. I took a deep breath and let it out. That was it, I would let that one go, not mention it again. Then without the minutest piece of guilt for my previous words, I carried on with,	“You’re still a cunt.” Steve then smiled, ignoring me, and said quietly.	“I like it better here, if you put all the gay shit to one side. The music’s better, and most of all, apart from those Mr. Universe wannabe’s, it’s not full of low life’s.”	I looked about and gave that one some thought. Steve was correct, where were all the alcoholics’, the predators, the rape gangs, the scruffy fucks, and the lost and lonely, I’d spent the last couple of days wandering through. I said,	“they weren’t all losers from what I could tell.” And reality was there were normal people there as well, people just like myself. The curious. Observing this exhibition of man-made human debauchery, much like patrons of a zoo. Except here, there was no moat or fence or giant window made from reinforced glass, the lookers on were inside the walls. Steve asked,	“You at my hotel?”	“Yeah, the manager wants a word with you about the minibar.”	“well when you next see him, tell him to stop basing his pricing on Paris.”	“You never been to Paris.”	“Don’t need to now.” 	“Anyway, no need, I paid it.”Steve then looked at me as though I’d done him a huge injustice. 	“What the fuck for?”	“I’m staying there – I didn’t need the dagger eyes okay?”	“Now I suppose I owe you $7000, plus the mini bar?”What the fuck was this, the man had lost $70,000. I thought, so I said.	“Maths was never your strong point was it?”Steve took a deep breath, thinking about that one, Then said,       “I only asked for seven – mum fucked up there, not me.”Even so he’d lost it, But I did not get around to reminding him of that small detail, as the next thing Steve said took me even more by surprise. The man drawing in the deepest of breaths before saying.  	“You know I’ve been sitting here for the last few days and the only thing I’ve been thinking is whether our father would of been thinking about guys in fluorescent undies when he fucked mum.” 	“Maybe?” I answered, and the moment I had, I wished I hadn’t entertained the stupidity of the comment. Steve then carrying on saying.	“you ever think he came to places like this with that guy?” I shrugged,       “does it matter?” I said, and I wasn’t wrong, it didn’t. Dad was gone and we missed him. The guy living his life in a cage he’d built for himself. And giving his own life up when that same cage broke open. Steve then suddenly said something that surprised me more than finding my brother sitting here in the first place.	“I’d have happily taken a dad who came here over what he’s left us with.” But that was an option we’d never been given. The man in such panic after being suddenly outed not giving any of us that choice. Steve then carried on,	“no wonder he did all that rolling around on the floor with other guys at the gym.”And he had done just that. Along with us both, there in the guise of learning the same self defence techniques which involved man handling your opponent into some intricately worked out floor move that cumulated with some other guys sweaty ass or crutch stuck in your face.      And as it dawned on me that my brother was perhaps sitting here for no other reason than he missed our father and that these two guys three bars down, one of which was gyrating in pink undies was nothing other than that, so I said.       “Dad’s gone Steve - Let it go.”      Then we sat for a moment again, both in silence. Two boys who loved girls, comfortable in a world as foreign to them as a Saharan shepherd at a Christian revival meeting, simply because it had been a slither of our fathers world. I gave it sometime, then took a deep breath.      “So what do you want to do?”      Steve shrugged and as he did I doubted his plan went further than buying another beer. I picked up the one Steve had not long before ordered for himself, “Listen.” I said      “If this guy here or the one up on that stage is not who you say he is. It’s okay.”Turning, Steve stared at me. The man now confused by my words.      “What?” He answered straight back in complete confusion. I carried on.      “If you’re here because you miss dad – you know - It’s okay, you don’t need to make up excuses.” Sitting there Steve thought about that one as he looked into the bar directly opposite, watching an oil soaked Thai man give him the eye. Taking a deep breath, he replied,“Feel free to leave whatever fucking psychology degree you found on the internet back at the hotel…. I’m here because Sherri’s brother is slapping his little Asian dick about up there on that stage being watched by the same guy who told me it was a good idea to invest in that shithole of a building. You think it’s anything different, that’s on you.”      “Just saying it’s okay - that’s all.” I said back, not giving in.      “Fuck off.” Hearing that, we both, sat in silence again for a moment as Steve pretended I wasn’t there. The body builders with their tight shirts clinging to their steroid induced soft muscle still smarting from the slight I’d slapped them with. The pricks giving me the occasional detestable glance.       “If you don’t believe me, go ask the guy.” Steve then said, without looking me in the eye.      “pretend you’re like dad, make out like you want to fuck and then beat a confession out of him.”      I laughed, good old Steve. When all else has failed just turn instead to violence. So that’s exactly what I decided to do.                      				***********                  I moved along to the bar and sat myself down. The man who was very nearly Steve’s brother-in-law now staring at my work boots. The fella covered in more oil than I’d seen working the tar sands. The man moving his gaze, staring me in the eyes, his mouth biting out at nothing.       Fuck me this is awkward, I thought, as I stared back and gestured for him to go upstairs. The man mouthing back to me 5000 Baht as he held five fingers in the air to make sure I understood.       Without a second thought I was up and heading towards the stairs. The man who was supposedly as straight as myself and drove a taxi in the off days, doing his best not to slip as he climbed off the stage to follow.       I reached the top and stopped. Then waited for Steve’s brother-in-law to catch up. The low voiced screams and panting of men now very apparent. Their animalistic tones floating out from behind closed doors that lined the corridor I now stood within. A very male looking Ladyboy exited a room and stared into my eyes as she passed me by. Steve’s brother-in-law reached the top of the stairs and without looking at me moved past. Then with the slightest of glances back, he disappeared into a room.        When I entered he was already sitting on the bed. The man’s oil soaked body glistening in the neon light from the window. The noise of the music now more apparent as it thumped through the floor. Looking at me the man said.      “Five thousand baht.”  And putting my hand into my pocket, I pulled out some money counted it and walking over held out my hand to pass him the money. As soon as his hand was next to mine I had his greasy wrist in the clasp of my hand and I had pulled him to the floor. Then, with a move I’d practiced for years with my father, I had him in an arm bar with one leg across his neck and the other behind his head as I stretched his arm back across my thigh until I thought there was little else for the joint to do other than to leave the man’s shoulder socket.       Doing my best to stop my hands slipping on his oily skin. I then used the sweaty  underside of my knee to cover his mouth and silence his screams.       Moments later the door burst open and Steve rushed in. He looked to the man on the floor covered in oil, with his eyes popping out of his head, and said.      “You fucking idiot, you got the wrong guy.”Letting the pressure off the man’s arm, but keeping him held fast I looked up at my brother.      “What the fuck are you talking about.”      “He’s the wrong guy!” I looked to the man’s pink underpants, then back to Steve. I said,	“They’re pink – you said the guy in pink undies?”	“I know - but I meant fuchsia.”Jesus Christ, my brother was stupid. I felt the man beneath my legs fighting to get his breath. Letting go of the pressure on his mouth and nose with my leg I felt him panic as I watched his eyes staring up at Steve. 	“I not know where sister!”What? I thought, did I hear that right? Not quite believing I’d accidently got the right guy, Steve stared down at the guy on the floor. The man still looking back in panic. 	“Sister bad woman – not here – I tell…” Letting go of the guy, I quickly got to my feet as the Thai man stood, then holding his ruptured shoulder sat himself on the edge of the bed. Still looking at Steve but wary of myself, he carried on. 	“She with her husband.”	“She’s Married?” Steve barked back in disbelief as he unconsciously held onto his head. And before the man could say another word the door opened and the Ladyboy who’d passed me five minutes prior stepped into the room. Taking a moment to size up the situation, and before I could move, she’d span around in her heels with a kick straight out of the Mai Thai knock out handbook and caught me straight in my hands as I guarded my chest and sent me off balance and staggering back straight through the centre of the window. 	With shattered glass all around me and the air completely gone from my lungs, I felt my body hit the outside canopy of the bar I’d just been sitting at and bounce off the tight fabric before I dropped another seven feet and hit a row of motorbikes lined up below. The bikes leaning at an angle and collapsing perfectly enough to break the second part of my fall. 	With the Ladyboy’s right shoe still in my hand, I hit the road outside with a thump and for the moment wondered how the fuck that had just happened as a crowd of gay guys watched on. Then Steve arrived, his face all in a fluster and helping me to my feet, said.	“Stop fucking about, we need to go quick.” 	Chapter Four      With my ribs hurting with every breath I sat at the pool of my hotel and stared at the Ladyboys red patent leather shoe I was still holding in my hand. Steve sitting there with his big cheese eating grin. Taking a deep breath, he said,       “Well we can cross off going back there for a beer now can’t we?”  Not bothering to answer, I just sat there studying the thin stiletto heal of the ladyboys shoe. Then tilting my head down I looked to the small red welt the same heel had left just below my heart. I looked back to the shoe, then to my brother.      “These are expensive - She’ll be missing this.” I replied, also wondering why we’d want to go back there apart from maybe to finish our chat with this straight gay gogo dancing cab driver. Steve saying back, as he watched me as I wondered how much the girl who’d kicked me through the window weighed. 	“You look like that prince in Cinderella.”And hearing that I could not help but think back to the lovely girl I’d met the night previous.       “If it makes you feel any better, from what I heard, you’re not the first western guy to be put through a window by a Ladyboy. It’s a thing here.” Steve then said,	“Thanks.”	“Yeah, their known for it, it’s one of their specialities.” 	“One?” I answered as I thought back to just how decent the lady had landed that blow to my chest.	“Yeah the other is one of them heels you’ve got in your hand stuck in your skull. So count yourself lucky, you got the window.”	“Speak for yourself.”	“The other speciality is that they can all suck their own dicks.”	“Bigamy is the other then it seems.” I answered now knowing that the girl Steve was about to wed was already married, as I also wondered how I’d be feeling,or if I’d be alive at all, if there had not been an awning and that line of motor cycles to break my fall. Letting the Bigamy dig go, Steve carried on,	“The other thing they say is – don’t fuck with the Thai’s.”The words slipping out of my brothers mouth in a manner that was either letting me know he did not believe this gogo taxi drivers declaration regarding his girl already being married, or he simply did not for some reason know what the word bigamy meant. Probably the latter.	“Is that right?”	“That’s what they say, especially the Ladyboys, but you already know that.”	“Thanks for the pre warning.”It was late, the only people now around were us and a guy in his late sixties relaxing in the pool with a girl less than half his age who looked as though she was hoping not to get her hair wet. I asked Steve,	“You staying here?”	“They refill that mini-bar?” he then replied, answering my question with a question of his own.They had, not that I was in the same room Steve had skipped the bill on, but if Steve was staying, I was thinking of having it emptied. Enough was enough with that shit.	“Where have you been sleeping since you snuck out of here?”	“Just some shit hole that took cash.”I then wondered if it was one of the small hotels that I’d checked.	“Near the beach?” I asked.	“Yeah you know how I like to go swimming in the morning.”It was then, and one of those overly nice reception women who’d smiled and ‘wayed’ with their hands up against their noses had been lying. But that was life I suppose, I said.	“And did you go?”Steve looked at me as though it was the stupidest question he’d ever heard.	“Every morning.”Fuck me, how had I missed him then? I thought.      “What time?” I asked.	“around nine.”	“The beach, the one right here?”	“What other beach is there?”I left that one - all I was going to do should I carry on with that line of enquiry was end up being told I was blind and to get some glasses.	“I been dancing in that big club on walking street in the evening, and was at the beach in the morning. I can’t believe you, how long you been looking for me? Fuck me, a blind man could have found me easier, you need to get some glasses.”            For fuck sake.       Changing the subject, I asked.	“I take it that other loser had gone by the time I hit the street?”Steve smiled. 	“By the time I’d got back down - Oh yeah, long gone”	“He see you come in?” 	“No - but I’m sure he saw you come out.”Well there was no escaping that. 					**********	It was late at the hotel pool, but early on walking street. Leaving the shoe in my room, we had both set off again. The silver haired man who’d been sitting outside the gay gogo bar I’d spectacularly left via the first floor window now, for the moment, thanks to me, back on the missing list.       We hit Walking Street, the place as always awash with noise and it’s strange mix of clientele. I looked to the seat where I had sat as we passed the bar I’d spent many hours sitting and watching people as they flowed to and fro. Scanning everyone coming and going in every direction, in the hope that my brother who I’d now safely found, came by. Another guy there now, beer in hand, the same as I had, watching the world pass by. 	I looked to the row of motorbikes all lined up where I’d first seen this lovely angel of a girl I’d met two nights back and wondered if the bike belonging to her was there? Maybe? Hers being the brand new bright red vespa I’d seen her arrive on the first night we’d met and there was one there exactly matching that spec. 	“When did you last eat?” I asked suddenly thinking of food and at the same time wondering how it was that I could remember the exact specs of the bike she rode, but not the girls name.      Steve smiled, it was obvious the man was more interested in finding the guy who had scarpered a couple of hours before. 	“Not hungry.” He snapped back. “You come all this way to eat, or you want to find this guy.” But Steve was hungry, despite his words. I could tell by the way he’d eyed up every food cart we’d passed since we’d left the hotel. 					**********Giving up on the idea of seeing the girl at the restaurant she worked at for now, we moved on. Passing through the sea of people, hearing the endless cat calls and noise. Steve, now with a burger in his hands as we walked. The bar where he’d first encountered the silver haired guy was the same establishment it turned out Steve had first met this Sherri girl. The silver fox sitting there night after night in his favourite little table booth. The guy not speaking a word to them both for a while, but then suddenly becoming best friends and talking up a storm one time Steve had come in. Telling Steve all the virtues of love and life in this town which in reality was very seldom true. The man not being there as we passed by. I looked to the derelict shopfront opposite my money was supposed to have transformed into the talk of the town and said.“This is ridiculous, we’ll never find this cunt.”Steve shook his head, the man now suddenly full of optimism.	“We will, if we wait, he’ll surface. Everyone surfaces in the end.”And I suppose he wasn’t wrong. Even Elvis had surfaced it seems, after all those years in hiding. Steve had but that had been what five days? Not forty years. And I’d only found him after this Vespa riding restaurant goddess had suggested an area I try looking. If she had not, where would I be now? Maybe with her, which wouldn’t have been too bad a thing.        We moved on and found another bar and sat at its front bench seating. Watching and waiting again to no avail. Bikers passing, sporting full leathers and long beards despite the heat. The Tourist Police watching them with caution. Western men, looking like mall security guards, doing a grand job in another country as they sat slumped with their fat muscles and fatter guts. Their Thai police counter parts sitting up straight and with pride, watching over them. I asked Steve. “What’s this guy’s name we’re looking for anyway?” Steve thought about it, He didn’t know, then answered, “can’t remember, probably phony any way.” But the answer to the question didn’t matter, because an hour later he had re surfaced and we’d found him again. 					***********  Bored, we had walked back in amongst it all and on our return found the guy sitting at the bar in exactly the same seat he’d been in when he’d given his speech to Steve. A speech which centred around how if he had the money he would be the guy buying the shop opposite. A speech he’d perfected over the years and had been delivered to Steve by a man with his fingers in many pies. One of which was true evil. This silver haired fox delivering a well-rehearsed monologue to any poor soul who would listen. A sales pitch designed to sell and to give hope. A communication intended to erase any doubt that had or would be seeping through and penetrating the rosy colored love goggles of a smitten man.        A man who felt and believed his life changing daily and knowing it was only going to get better. A man dripping with kisses and soaked in love. A man who in his younger years could give two fucks about religion or Jesus; now a converted plastic Buddhist, wearing amulets around his neck and praying to a god he did not know. 	So there he was, this silver tongued salesman who’d I seen only five hours before. The man now sitting drinking alone after midnight. Steve said, as we waited one block along watching the man taking sips of his beer as another fellow wearing cargo pants that did not fit approached and sat himself down next to him at the bar.  	“When that guy in the shorts fucks off, Why don’t I go in there and get chatting and tell him my tale of woe? See what he says.” I thought about it, then shook my head. 	“You said the man’s a bullshitter, why would you expect anything more than that?”And then with a slam of his glass down onto the table the silver haired fox took an envelope which the guy sitting next to him had pulled from the side of his baggy shorts, and was up and out the door and back in the open-air walking towards us through the crowd.	We followed him as he went. The man with his head down on a mission. He reached a go-go bar and without a moment of hesitation stepped inside. 	“He could have seen us and disappeared straight out the rear?” Steve said as we stood at the side of the road a good one hundred feet further back.	“Well lets see?” I said, “go find the back entrance and I’ll go inside and if he sees me and runs, then we’ll know for sure.”	Then I walked on alone and took myself straight through the front door. It was a place I already knew, having passed through it looking for Steve twice a night since my arrival. There was always this sexy girl there, dressed in a black latex cat suit. The girl looking good, wandering about the place wobbling her titties and ass nightly. The guys on the door, no doubt thinking I’d be doing my usual quick tour and departure this time around, the same as I had every other occasion previous. Nodding to them both, I stepped inside. Keeping out of the man’s eye-line I sat myself down on the other side of the room from this gentleman we were now following. Being closer I could see that he was older, a lot older than he’d looked from a distance. The man looking suave with his silver fox hair and his little dickie bow tie. The dark below his eyes telling me he needed sleep. A sleep that did not seem to be coming anytime soon, as the very same captivating young girl dressed in a black latex catsuit was now no longer wandering about the club but sitting on his lap.       I looked up at the stage to the girls in tiny shorts or panties as they danced. Swinging one leg in front of the other with as much enthusiasm needed to keep their job. Some girls young, others looking maybe too young. Others just squeezing out what was left of their looks in the hope of finding some lonely prince-charming who would pull them off the stage and whisk them away.Girls, Girls, Girls - All crowding the stage. Dancing to find love. Swaying their bodies for the love of their families. Sending whatever money they could from dancing in this cramped stinking airconditioned shithole or gained from laying down with or fleecing some sad loser they’d met here.             The girls doing the same moves and hitting the champagne rooms not to dissimilar to the girls with the same occupation working the clubs in Calgary. Instead here the money went home. Feeding kids, along with mum and dad and granny and grandpa if they were still around instead of on drugs and the occasional college degree.	From the corner of my eye I watched this man with his swept back grey hair and his little dickie bow. The girl on his lap digging for oil with her tongue into the man’s ear as though she was doing a wax extraction at the local clinic. The pretty girl in her cat suit on his lap feigning extasy as she did, poking out her titties as she closed her eyes. The guy with his mouth open, his breath stinking from rancid gums, whisky and beer. 	I looked up at the stage to see a host of girls looking back at me and smiling, waving with their tiny petite hands. None of the damsels a patch on Vespa girl. The most beautiful young woman I had ever met – whose name I could not remember, the fool that I am.	Not to look out of place I called two of the girls over and seconds later they were squeezing in on the long bench either side of me and between a man who from the veins on his neck looked as though he was one step away from cardiac arrest. The girls asking, “who I was?” and “where I from?” And I just smiled, telling them I was Johnny and I work the oil. The girls on my lap turning their heads slightly trying to catch my words through the boom – boom - boom.   	I signalled the waitress over and bought drinks for myself and my new two young friends. The girls smiling, being cute. The man next to me watching them more than the beautiful girl he was with. The girls in their little shorts and long silken hair, rubbing my chest and my crutch. Both taking turns to sit on my lap and rub their haunches into my loins as they kissed my ears. I looked around, the place jam packed with losers just like me. Alone, or in small groups. All with girls doing their own bumping and grinding. Drinking their watered down lady drinks as they slid their crutches along strange fat men’s hairy pasty open legs. Then I heard the man next to me say out loud.	“Fuck man this place is the best!”And it was, I suppose, if you didn’t give a fuck. Which it seemed here was the major consensus.	“Fuck man this snatch is wild.” The pig carried on.Two young ladies right there and then paying me more attention than any women or girlfriend had ever done. The girls feeling my muscles and my strength. Seemingly having more fun than they were moments before, as they’d put one foot in front of the other in perpetual boredom, repeatedly on the stage.       The man next to me then standing with pride. His demeanour letting everyone around him know he had pulled this beautiful girl and was leaving for no doubt a chemically enhanced fuck. The man for once in his life feeling like a king. Myself blurting out to him in my usual fashion, as I now seemed to do. 	“Yeah - well worth the hundred bucks.” Then saying “sweaty fatty cunt.” out loud as I watched him go. I called the waitress over and bought another round of drinks. Then I did it again. Curiously, I asked the girls through the music in the same broken English they spoke.	“Where you from?”The girls happy that for once, someone was, actually showing an interest in them.	“Issan.” The first girl replied, as did the next, as did the next, and as did the other two that came over after I’d ordered another three drinks for us all. The girls, all from the north east of the country, surrounding me, having fun. Telling me their almost unpronounceable names. Names, which again I instantly forgot. The night moving on in a sea of beautiful young women. Women with their long black hair, tight waists and wonderful happy smiles. The lights in the ceiling whirling, crashing into my eyes, the music blaring as the girls made me feel special. These beautiful, honest, wonderful goddesses, flanking my sides. Kissing and grinning as they pulled open their silky dressing gowns that had suddenly appeared. Showing off their flawless bodies and their titties as they leant down and licked and probed their tongues into my ears. The girls linking their arms to yet another gorgeous girl who stood at my feet, spreading her naked body before me as she closed the gap creating my own little love booth with her dressing gown. The girl standing guard as her friend from Issan knelt before me rubbing herself upon my engorged dick as she forced her nipples into my face and leant down and kissed my lips. 	Closing my eyes as I felt the silk of her tongue and the sensation of the two girls at my side as they lapped at my ears with their tongues and rubbed their soft hands upon my chest. Then the longing as the girl pulled my engorged dick from my cut down jean shorts and took it in her mouth. Then as the feeling of ecstasy ran through my body, I heard through the music my brother say,	“Sandy - What the fuck are you doing?” 	Opening my eyes, I looked to Steve. The man staring down at me as I held my beer in hand with my shirt undone and my dick sticking out of my cut-off jeans.	“What’s it look like?”  	“You’re supposed to be watching that fucking guy?”	“I am.” I answered, as I looked over to see he was no longer there. 	“Well he’s gone?”	“I know that.” I answered as I took another swig at my beer and smiled to the girl who had just had her breasts in my mouth. Then I asked.	“when did he leave?”Shaking his head as he looked to the girls that now surrounded me, he said.	“He went off with cat woman - he’s upstairs.”	“So what’s the problem?”There wasn’t one. Not at that particular moment anyhow. Far from it. Apart from the fact that my younger brother had stolen something special from me and completely broken some magical trance- induced love spell I’d been put under. 	Knowing I would never see these beauty’s again, I told the girls I’d be back in a moment. Then with Steve in tow and passing a plethora of women on the stage I headed for the stairs. 	We hit the corridor up top and walked along the shabby walkway as girls and men with fat red noses and fatter guts passed us in the opposite direction heading for the stairs. The music from below drowning out the muffled noise and fake groans coming through the doors that led to the rooms where dreams came true. Reaching out I tried a handle, opened the door, to see a man laying naked as two naked girls kneeled next to him on the bed kissing his dick. The man looking to me as I said, 	“How you doing?”	“Better than you.” Was all he replied. And truth was, right then and there I suppose in my pickled fucked up mind, he wasn’t wrong. For what was I doing? Searching for some silver haired fox who was no doubt doing pretty much the same as this guy. I closed the door and looked to Steve and shook my head as he stared back in anticipation behind me.  	“No.”He looked to the next door and reaching out turned the handle and again found it to be open. Then said,	“No locks, must be a thing I suppose.”   He was right, as I’d found that out earlier, to my detriment. No locks were allowed, for the girls safety, and so as security could practice their Muay Thai. 	The next room was much the same. Some sweaty fat fuck, on the verge of a cardiac, laying on a well-worn bed. The man looking up in surprise with his red face as he smothered some poor young lady. But the next door along though, we found him. The silver fox with tears in his eyes, facing the wall on all fours. The man lost in the moment, as he panted and screamed, whilst the same lady I’d seen downstairs, parading about the club in her latex cat suit fucked him in the ass from behind. Both Steve and I watched for a moment in disbelief. It was something to behold. This latex cat woman goddess with her body and features straight out of a Victoria Secret photo shoot, still fully clothed, slamming this smooth tongued rascal with her dick as he screamed. When he could not take the visual any longer, Steve said out loud.	“When you’re done, maybe we can talk some more about that bar.”The girl stopping mid stroke. Turning to look at us in surprise. The ladyboy pulling out and standing in her nice heels, staring at us as her condom filled with sperm swung from her dick.  I thought then as I stared at her standing there about how many times in the past I’d pulled out, then stood there in my socks and looked down at the same view of a creamy latex sheath dangling from my dick. This though, was somehow slightly different. I said, 	“put your dick away and sit yourself down beautiful.” Grabbing the sheets, the silver haired fox quickly covered himself as he stood. Then said, 	“It’s not what it seems.”	“Listen… You could have the Thai army waiting outside to run a train through you and I wouldn‘t care. What you do for fun is not why we’re here. All I need to know is what happened to my money?”	The man stared to Steve and then back to me, and for the moment it seemed as though he didn’t have a clue as to who we were. Then looking to Steve for a moment, he said. 	“I remember you – you’re the guy whose girl disappeared.” He wasn’t wrong. The man in a fluster, carrying on saying.      “Look a lot of guys here get taken, even me. I’ve been taken, you’re not alone! What makes you think you are so special? Just look at it like a rite of passage and move on. It’s what I did.”Steve tutted as he looked to the ladyboy as she pulled the used condom from her dick, tucked herself away and dropped the condom on the floor next to her high heeled shoes. Then shaking his head he turned back to the silver fox and asked. 	“Where’s Sherri?”	“Who the fuck’s Sherri? The man spat back quickly, as his eyes pleaded innocence. 	“My girl, the one who’s brother you went to see tonight.”	“What?” Stepping in, I said. 	“You went to see Sherri’s brother. Where is she?”The silver haired fox stared at the ladyboy for a moment, looking for help, then to his underpants which were neatly folded over the back of a chair. I said,	“You should have kept your clothes on like your girlfriend here.”	The man took a deep breath, then with his hands held out in front of himself, he looked at Steve and said. 	“Okay, you’ve been ripped off, I’m sorry for this, but it had nothing to do with me. That bar we spoke of, it’s solid. I had no idea your woman wasn’t. I swear…..”	“Nothing to do with you, yet you went to see her brother?” Steve said straight back.	“What brother? I was in boystown this evening, but it was to see if I could find Diana.”	“Diana?”	“Yeah Diana,” The man said back, “Like the princess.” He looked towards the ladyboy standing at the end of the bed who looked nothing like the late princess, the man making sure we both understood it was her he was referring to. Diana the ladyboy looking as though she had one thought and one thought only – get me the fuck out of here. With the focus now on her. She simply said, in perfect English.	“This has nothing to do with….. I was never here, okay?”	“Shut the fuck up.” Steve said, which surprised me, as he’s usually polite with women. I gave him a what the fuck are you doing, look. He said,	“No one here has mentioned the brother sells his ass in Boystown except you?”	The silver fox blurting out in frustration.       “I was in boystown, that’s why I mentioned it, for fuck sake? So tell me please, what the fuck do you want? You can’t just come in here and do this shit!”	“tell us where Sherri is and you can carry on where you left off”	“I don’t know, man for Christ’s sake – how many times can I tell you - I - don’t – know! All I did was give sound advice about a business. That’s it? I said it then and I’ll say it now, if I had the resources - I’d have bought the place!.... If that women had been on the level, you’d have been set.”	The guy was convincing I’d give him that. But for a guy who had just had two strangers walk in on him whilst he was getting fucked in the ass by some woman who looked like a lead in a kids super hero action movie, he should have been more shocked - it just didn’t seem to add up. I said,	“Okay enough dialogue,” as I walked across the room and taking the man by the arm, I carried on with. 	“I don’t want you to say another word okay. As I then yanked him violently to the floor. With practiced perfection, I tucked one leg under his shoulder blade and the other across his neck and, feeling his free hand tug upon my leg, I proceeded to begin to remove his arm from it’s shoulder socket. 	Screaming into the underside of my knee, as the pain ripped through his body, the silvered haired fox let go of my leg and smashed his hand against the floor in a submissive attempt to get me to stop as he gnashed his teeth trying to bite my leg. Only once I’d felt the joint pop out of the socket and seeing the reaction to the sound in both the ladyboy and Steve’s face, did I stop. Letting the back of my knee up from across the man’s mouth, the man began to spit and scream out.	“You god damn mother fucking cock sucking son of a bitch…”	“It’s best you don’t go there?” I replied, as I looked over to Diana now sitting on the bed looking down at me as though this was just a normal occurrence in the world she lived in. Then I said, as I started to put the pressure now on his elbow.	“Your elbows next and I won’t stop there.”I then looked back at Diana and just as I was about to speak, I heard the Silver Fox say into the underside of my knee.	“Okay, okay, I’ll tell you everything!”Standing up, I let the man do the same and watched as he grimaced and held onto his shoulder. It hurt, I knew that much, as having a grappling obsessed father, I’d been on the receiving end of the maneuver more times than I cared to remember. In a show of good faith I stepped towards the now wary man as he cowered, naked, in front of me. Gripping his shoulder with one hand and his whole body with the other I snapped his shoulder joint back into its  socket, then threw the man his underpants, and said.	“You can spill the beans once you’re dressed.” 	In pain he slipped on his underpants and sat himself on the bed next to the ladyboy. The pretty girl still looking as though she had better places to be. Steve said.	“Okay start talking…. And if we feel you’re holding back, I’ll personally rip out the other shoulder myself, and I won’t put it back.”Taking a deep breath, the man stared at Steve for a moment, then looked at me. 	“I get $500 cash for telling whoever this Sherri or any other girl sends my way, the truth.”	“The truth?”	“Yes, the truth,” the man then said, nodding as he held his shoulder. “Like I keep saying, it’s a good investment.”	“But you know that these women are scamming.”	“Sometimes, yes.” Cutting in before Steve could get anymore emotionally carried away, I asked, 	“Who owns the bar?” 	“Fuck knows. I wish it was me…. I used to think that if these women kept this up I’d end up with enough cash to buy the fucking place myself.”	“So you’ve done it before with Sherri?” Steve asked as his voice hit a pitch I had not heard since I was a kid. The same kind of squeal he’d give if things weren’t going his way with mum and dad.	“And this would surprise you?” the man scoffed back. “You think you’re the only guy this girls had her hooks into.” The Silver Fox staring at Steve for a moment, the man holding his shoulder as he began to grin. Spitting out as he did, “for fuck sake, you’re still in love, even now after she’s taken you for what, seven odd grand? That would be the usual figure.”	“Seventy.” I said straight back, and looked at the man on the bed, for the first time now seeing what was true honesty in his face. 	“Seventy…… Seventy - fucking – grand! Are you fucking kidding me?” the man spat back as he began to laugh. “why the fuck would you give a stranger seventy fucking thousand. Are you some sort of fucking moron?”	I looked at Steve - only he could answer that one, and trying to, he simply said. 	“Well there’s more to it.” Thinking my brother was about to elaborate I wait a moment. Then when nothing came, I said.	“Cut the self-righteousness bullshit and keep talking.” The man listening as he took a deep breath, then said as he stared now at the floor.	“This girl Sherri, she’s not from Issan like the rest of the girls here. She’s from the south. She’ll be waiting there until she’s heard that you’d stopped crying in your soup and fucked off back to whatever rock you crawled out of.”       Knowing the man was just trying to preserve what little he had left of his pride, I let that one go. 	“Heard from who – you?” I asked.  The man looked to the floor for a bit. Then said. 	“yeah me, or one of her friends or her husband….” As he looked up and stared right into Steve’s eyes, the man knowing and enjoying the fact the words would hurt, as he said, 	“She’s married, you know that right?”	“Yeah I heard,” Steve snapped straight back.	“Well, she’s married to this guy who she’d go and fuck in the morning when you went swimming.” And if the man’s words hurt my brother, Steve didn’t let on, but knowing him better than he knew himself, I knew they must have. I said, shutting him down.	“mind I don’t throw you out that fucking window.” Taking the hint, the Silver Fox went quiet, but if he had listened and taken heed of my warning, it didn’t seem to last long, as he continued, staring straight at my brother,        “you know I used to be a cop here, you think I don’t know people still. You’re in trouble pal. You and your fucking ape. All of them have had enough of sob story losers like you.” Then the man sat there thinking about it for a moment. Lifting his head, he carried on as he looked straight at me, 	“I heard the husbands gone though. Not here so you’re wasting everyone’s fucking time. Guys probably a monk now or something, so you’re fucked.”	“Heard - from who?” I asked.	“The brother.” 	“The brother?” I asked as I saw the man begin to smile as his face changed along with his demeanor. The Silver Fox snapping back at me, drawing courage from some corner of his mind. The man saying. 	“Yeah, of course – the brother - you fucking idiot - The same guy you were fucking with when I sent that ladyboy up to his room so as I could watch her throw ‘you’ through that fucking window, just like I asked her to do.”	I stared at the man for a moment, then asked.	“You arranged that?”	“Yeah – I did!” The Silver fox spat back as his temper began to rise. “So fuck you, and if you come near me again - next time, you won’t hit no fucking motorbikes on the way down because you’ll be going out from the next fucking flight up.”And hearing that, I looked to the Diana, the ladyboy, who looked just like my girl and asked calmly.	“He pay you yet?”The girl nodding that he had as she sat there clutching onto her small, fake, YSL bag. Her whole being just wanting to be on the other side of the shitty rooms unlockable door. Reaching out I grabbed the man’s trousers, pulled his wallet from one of the pockets and threw it at him. 	“pay her again.” I said, as I stared at this parasite of a man.       “The money’s ours anyway.”	Then I watched as the man reluctantly stared at his wallet.”	“Fucking do it!” I said as I watched him begin to open his wallet and pull some small bills from its inside. 	“Fuck off you tight cunt, give her the whole lot.” I said as I watched his body language again begin to change. The man seemingly more annoyed at that suggestion than the fact I’d just ripped his arm from its socket. Staring at me as though I was crazy, he said.	“Fuck that.”      Then snatching the wallet from his hand I opened it up. It was pretty full, the nice soft leather interior holding the envelope he’d been given in the other bar. Opening it I looked inside to see a neat and tightly packed stack of 1000 Baht notes. Pulling the lot, I fanned them out, handed them to Diana. Then said, 	“Go get yourself circumcised.”      Without waiting for another word, the girl was up and out the door without looking back, as the man called out after her.	“You owe me that money, you fucking asshole shithead.” Then as his temper burst into something he was seemingly unable to control, he turned back to Steve. Snarling with spittle flying from his mouth, he spat out,       “you motherfucking prick! Why couldn’t you just have fucked off like the fucking loser you are? You think I won’t get that money back, well I fucking will. And you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this town with this fucking clown.”       But even if in the man’s eyes she did, owe him the money I just gave her, which some other shithead had just given him for whatever reason. Whatever thoughts of revenge he was going to exact upon us for this intrusion into his world, he was never going to retrieve or see any retribution, as the next thing I did was lean down, grab the man by his nicely cut silver hair and in one hard and fast move, I dragged the grey haired old fuck in his undies off the bed saying as I went,      “Time to go.” And before he could come to terms with what he’d just heard, he was sailing through the air and straight through the window.                   Chapter Five			With Steve still pissed at me we reached the outside alley at the back of the club. The ground beneath my boots uneven and loaded with empties. The silver fox now laying somewhere at the front with his neck broken from the fall. The ladyboy in her latex cat suit having vanished into thin air almost before the glass had shattered and the sound of the man hit the road with a thud had reached the room.	“You’re a fucking idiot?” Steve said as we left the alley and joined the crowd that now surrounded the man’s body. 	“Why?” I asked as I glanced down at the fuck head. His arm once again removed from its shoulder socket from the fall and wrapped around his bleeding skull in a totally unnatural fashion.	“you didn’t need to kill him.”	“I didn’t kill him – the fall did - just the same as the one he arranged for me could’ve killed me.”	“Is that right?” Steve asked as he wandered on staring at the floor thinking. Then he asked.	“You know, that was a strange thing to see.”	“What the guy going out the window?”	“No the other thing – when we came in the room.” It was strange, I can’t deny that and at the same time I’d seen the girl taking the man from the rear I have admit I’d wondered if this goddess I’d met the night before had been the same sort of girl? She had that look, the prettiness, the same super model build. Steve said,	“You think dad was a giver or a taker like that fuck head?”       “Giver, definitely a giver.” I answered, but it was something I didn’t want to consider. Not now or anytime for that matter. Dad was dad and all I wanted to do was remember the strong fighting man he presented to us as children. Steve said as we passed a crowd of drunken English men.      “Yeah you’re right. I think, by the way he used to throw us about he would have had to be on top.” 	“Dad was dad Steve, don’t turn him into something other than that.” I said, changing the subject, Steve then asked, 	“you think that guy was telling the truth and Sherri did this to a lot of guys?” Now that’s a loaded question I thought.  One that needed sensitivity in its answer. So I said,	      “Yeah, sounds like this Sherri girl’s a whore. Suckered loads of guys probably.” Steve staying quiet for a moment before saying. 	“Okay.” Then as if I had not dumped a container ship of emotion on my brothers shoulders I carried on saying.      “But we’ll know more when we ask her husband, when we find him.”	“If we find him.” Steve answered quickly, as he looked up from the floor.Yeah - if we find him. 					***************Like I said, I had killed before. The third, being that silver haired fuck, the second being the last person that had ripped my brother off. The first; well, we’ll get into that a little later. All that mattered now was that we get the fuck out of dodge and down to the south. There was a girl down there somewhere who was married to some prick who apparently had the $70,000 some dead man had found funny that my brother had given them. 	      We walked back to the hotel through the crowds. Feeling the humid still air along with the heat. The usual mixture of lost and lonely, hanging onto what they had once upon a time been. The girls at their sides looking to suck away what little these men had left in this life. I turned to Steve and said as one sorry assed guy walked past hand in hand with a girl half his age.	“That could have been you in a few years’ time.” Steve, saying straight back at me.	“from what I saw in that club, it could’ve been you tomorrow.” He replied.	And I suppose he wasn’t wrong. If I was being true to myself. I was already one of these men. For I had also walked, as though it was the norm, this same road with a beautiful girl by my side.	“I might hit that club.” Steve said as we carried on. 	“What about that silver haired guy?” I asked. 	“Well he won’t be there.” Steve answered as he looked back briefly towards the crowd.And he wouldn’t be, that was for certain. Not now - not ever. The man sealing his own fate by underestimating the severe response his vile words might bring. I said,	“Well if you meet a girl, make sure her dicks smaller than yours.”I walked on, now alone. Steve doing the same thing he had always done throughout our lives when the shit had hit the fan. Disappear into his own little world, be it in some club or karaoke room where he’d pretend to be Elvis or some other crooner who like the silver haired fox was long gone from this world.   		Ten minutes later I was back outside the restaurant. The beautiful girl in there, just as she had been before. The girl looking lovely with her long hair and warming smile. Her clothes perfect as though she had just stepped out from a catalogue shoot. Taking a step back I sunk myself into a doorway and felt the humid air surround my being. Wondering about my own clothes, I looked down at my cut down jeans and big boots. Fuck I was a slob; but some girls like it that way, or so I was told. If this girl I was now coveting was a girl that is, and from what I had seen so far in this strange place, with how pretty and perfect she was, I have to be honest, I really wasn’t sure. 	Time passed, and the more it did the more I felt like the loser I was. Having just killed a guy for having a ladyboy throw me out a window and being part of a gang that had stolen my money which after retrieving a small portion back I’d only then given it away again to a cat suited woman with a dick. It was really hard to convince myself otherwise. Without seeing the girl throughout the last hour once look outside whilst I’d been standing there like a fool, I then watched as the girl inside picked up her phone and began to type. Moments later my phone beeped and it was her. And the message read……	‘I’m done – You can come in now?’ 				********************      We sat at the same table as we had sat the first night I had come into the restaurant. The girl looking just as beautiful as ever. Smiling she said,       “So, tell me, do you think I’m a guy hey?”How the fuck could she know that? I thought.       There was no denying it as after seeing the girl in the cat suit with the same look and features with a condom hanging from her dick I now had a different perspective on things. There was no way though that I was going to say that, not a chance. Why would I? Why would I knowingly go out of my way to fuck things up between us. So I said,       “Yes.”The girl sitting there, shocked at my bluntness but still smiling as the crowds of people passing just mere feet on the other side of the window filed by. The restaurants staff cleaning up behind us in the background. She said,      “Yeah well I thought you may. With my sister and everything.”            Her sister?            “but, you really don’t remember much from last night do you?”             She has a sister?             This girl wasn’t wrong. It was true. My drinking having once again scrubbed anything good or bad from my memory.       “Well,” the girl said staring at me waiting for a reply as my mind turned. She carried on asking, “how much have you had to drink tonight, maybe this evening will disappear in much the same manner?”       After all that had happened so far, that would never happen.             “Well, you know Sandy, I’m not going to tell you what happened. I’m not. And the reason is I enjoyed yesterday even if you can’t remember a thing it seems. The good thing is though, is that you are here and I should be grateful for that.”      “Thanks,” I said as I wondered how someone could be that understanding and nice. It just didn’t seem real.       “Yeah, thanks.” I said again as I stared at her. This girl with beautiful brown eyes, looking back at me with curiosity as I scanned her blouse for some sort of name tag. Her name still being the big issue with me not knowing it, despite everything. So with that there was also the chance I could still blow it all right here and now before I was lucky enough for things to progress any further than they had. In panic I thought,            Wait, just wait. Talk about something, anything - at some point she’ll say her name and you’ll be back on track. Just be cool - all cool - no problem. Just get on the subject of her sister. Don’t go asking her why’s she with an ugly fucker like myself - Jabber on about her for a bit and it’ll come.              So I said,      “So what’s your name again?”      “May.” May answered with a smile. Then I said, hating myself.       “Why?”      “Why what?”      “Why you with an ugly fuck like me? Why does a girl as pretty as you not have some other guy waiting for you to finish your shift?” May shrugged, it was either she did not care or it was none of my business. I carried on asking,       “You must have other guys ask you out?” with that one May smiled, and with the cutest of twist to her head, she asked.      “you jealous Sandy?”      And in truth, I guess I was. Then May answered my question.       “Well yes, it is true. I do get asked out – a lot - Be it here or at the place my sister works. But I’d just disappoint the guys there.”      Her sister again?             “And?”      “And – do I ever say yes? Is that what you are asking?” May replied with a smile.       It was.    	             “well, no never. You don’t want to be involved with a guy who comes here. Some girls though mostly Issan women, yeah, they do. They’re here to meet any type of man and they don’t seem to care if he’s a bad person or not. They seem ok with the fact that the man has come here to have sex. But that’s not me.”	I looked at her confused, this girl who seemed so sure of herself, so confident, talking in contradictions. I said.	“Well you’re here with me though.”	“But you’re not here for sex, you’re here for your brother, who’s here for sex, and had his heart stolen along with his wallet in the process... That and I like your boots.” Fuck me, I must have said a lot. Smiling, I looked down beneath the table at my boots. The incredibly tanned leather, beaten but still holding strong. “and guys coming here looking to get laid, usually change out of their work clothes.” “You’re lucky it wasn’t winter or I’d be still in my big coat.” I said with a smile.	“I’d like that.” May said while she watched as I pulled out my phone and bought up a photo of myself standing there on a rig in minus thirty five. 	“Wow!” She said as she stared at the photo.  “How could a girl resist?”Girl? That was still the question which needed answering. Although according to her it was something I already knew and somewhere deep down I knew I’d got away with asking once already. Calling her a guy a second time, well, maybe she wouldn’t be so accommodating. If I did, maybe I’d ruin things before they got started. So for now just let it go.I thought, as I watched May shake her head slowly from side to side in amazement as she stared at the picture I’d shown her. The snow around me brilliant white in the sun, ice floating in the air yet solid beneath my feet. Looking up she said.      “I’d love to go and experience cold like this.” I said,	      “Well you’ll need a big coat or you’ll freeze your balls off.”            				******************                  The next morning I woke Steve and with the man looking like a train wreck I dragged him down to breakfast. The guy sitting there looking worse than the sex tourists we sat amongst with his hair up on end. Myself with him looking as though I’d stepped straight off an oil rig. I looked at the guys seated around us at their own tables, quietly eating with their fat guts and holiday wives half their age. Myself, bar my brother, on my own.             How would I look if in the future I’d been lucky enough to have May here with me.             I thought. If she was a girl that is. Looking up, Steve said,       “I met this lovely girl last night.” Well at least he was moving on, I thought.      “but she just reminded me of  Sherri, so I blew her off.”Taking a deep breath, I stared at my egg and bacon that was looking too dry and shook my head. The boy being jovial one minute and down the next. Right now it was the latter it seemed. Not wanting to make him worse, I knew I needed to be careful with my words, so I said.        “For fuck sake - Why you so cut up about some grifter whore?” And Steve without a beat said straight back.      “I was thinking that maybe it was this husband’s doing and not her?”Okay, that was it. I’m no longer holding back, the man needs to be told. I said, not holding back.       “The answer to that gem is right there under your nose Steve - husband, being the key word.” And hearing that Steve just stared at me confused. He said.       “One minute, you’re swearing the next your sounding like some sort of school counsellor. I don’t get it.”  And neither did I. If I didn’t want to swear I swore. If I wanted to tell someone to fuck off. I was compassionate. The guy didn’t deserve this, I needed to apologize, he had enough on his plate with our father and all. So I said,        “You stupid dumb fuck moron!”      “Maybe she’d left him?” Steve said back without a second thought, and I looked about the restaurant at the other guests now staring.      “Maybe she was fucking her husband when you were swimming like that grey hair guy said she was?” I asked. Steve looking to me as he took in my words, the young man unable to believe what he’d just heard.      “You believe that mouthy grey haired old cunts word?”      “How did he know she was doing it whilst you were swimming then?”Steve sat there silent for a moment as he ran that one through his pickled brain. Then he said.       “Lucky guess - I’d have known, I’d have seen it.” Unable to stop myself I said  “You’d have known. you’d have seen it.” You’re that good hey? Just like mum?”      	 				****************      One thing you can do if you ever want to buy a car in Thailand and you don’t want to pay the dealer markup is just walk around for a bit and eventually you’ll see a car for sale at the side of the road. If the counties just suffered a drought or is under any other economic stress, you’ll find two or more. And by eleven o’clock the same morning after dragging Steve away from the pool I was the proud new owner of a 1980 Honda Civic, complete with racing trim, exhaust and wheels, plus blacked out windows. All purchased from a man who’d stood there in his flipflops and shorts who was happy to let the machine go for a surprisingly low price of 120,000 Baht - which is all the bank machine would allow that day from the three credit cards I’d bought with me from Alberta.	I changed gear, whipping the car down to third as I raced along a main street which would take us to another toll road for the journey south. Putting my foot down I tried to accelerate past a truck carrying almost seven times more than it would have been rated for in its country of origin. My newly purchased wheels not only noisy but  pretty fast to boot. With a big grin Steve looked at me as we went. The man playing with the back scratching stick the previous owner had gifted with the vehicle and left for us on the dash board.	“What the fucks this?”	“Back scratcher.” I answered, not quite believing the man had never seen one or couldn’t work it out for himself. Steve looking at the two foot long thin stick with a little tiger claw carved into the end. 	“Fuck me.” Was all he said. I looked to the bucket seat he was sitting in covered in some sort of synthetic lambs wool. Then said.	“Maybe it’s the seats. Maybe they is itchy when it gets hot.” Steve putting his hand to the air vent and feeling the cold airconditioned air streaming through. Then fiddling with the little switch on the door he opened the window to let a burst of hot air waft in and fill the car. The car bumping and rattling as we hit bad road. 	“Holy fuck, this is a piece of shit.” Steve then said as he felt every bump, taking each thump he felt in his backside as some sort of personal vendetta against him. “Seriously if you hadn’t given cat woman all that money,” he carried on saying, “then we could have gotten ourselves a real car with suspension.”	“If you had not given your fiancé $70,000 we could have bought a Mercedes.” I said quickly back. Steve thought about that one for a moment then with his head turned away as he looked out of the passengers side, he said straight into the open window.	“You’d never have come here had she not stolen it.”	And that was true, maybe. But somehow, strangely now, I was glad she had stolen the money and I had come, even if I had thrown some loser out of a window.       We hit some lights and sat there as the space in front of us quickly filled with motorbikes. Their riders weaving themselves into pole position after screaming their bikes one hundred and twenty five cc engines to the limit in a bid to keep up.  	“Cheeky pricks.” Steve said as he watched them file in front one after the other as we waited for the lights to change. My stupid brother then holding the back scratcher out of the window with his arm and roaring like a lion as he rasped the little scratching claw at the end of the stick through the air at the bikers. The guy like a child. Then like the idiot he is, he dropped it, and before he could open the door to pick it up another bike had whipped along the side of the car, run the stick over, and snapped it like a twig. 	“Fuck,” Steve said as he heard the back scratcher break into pieces. “That guy, just broke the fucking thing and didn’t give a shit?”The lights changed and I began to slowly pull forward. The mass of motor bikes screaming away with their throttles held open to the max before us. Steve sitting there like a plum as he watched this felon who with wanton disregard for Steve had just broken the boys toy and disappeared into the distance. For a moment, Steve just sat there. Not saying a word before hitting the switch again and closing the window. Then he simply said. 	“Don’t need sticks anyway – that’s why god give us nails.” But make no mistake about it, the nails god had blessed my brother with were never going to be long enough or sharp enough. 					***********	We carried on. Finding the ramp to the toll booth we then rode the toll road along the highway as it took a long downward curve hugging the coastline below Bangkok. Our new car, seemingly never not noisy with its fuck you exhaust system. Trucks of all sizes weaving around us. Their turbo’s whistling whilst their overloaded engines belched black smoke as they tried their best to push us off the road. Motorbikes with riders the best and worst I have ever seen, taking their small engine bikes to the max with little sense of self-preservation as they flowed freely like the wind in the scorching hot sun. Steve watching them as they flew along weaving between cars one after the other, sometimes four person strong. Telling me as he watched them pass.	“My backs itchy.” 	“Seriously - You’re like a child.” I told him as I watched him unsuccessfully try to reach that sweet spot no man can reach in the centre of his back. 	“Scratch it for me would you.” I would not. There was no chance. Instead I said.	“It’s your penance for being an idiot.” Ignoring me he tried again once, then twice to relieve the itch, then settling for the use of the side of the seat to do the work he said as he watched another rally of motorbikes rip past us lane splitting in the traffic flow.   	“These guys are fucking nuts. They looking to kill themselves.”	And they were, I thought, there was very little doubting that. In fact, it seemed they all were, apart from the percentage of those, like me, who were there hoping to complete their journey without getting killed. Unable to stop myself and hating myself straight after - I said.	“Yeah kill themselves – just like dad.” 	Then I looked to Steve, the kid’s face steeped in pain at the thoughtless words that had wildly exited my mouth.       I waited as I drove for my brother to speak. Something I had done many times before when we were kids. Back then when I could see he was either troubled or just plain sulking. An hour or so later as the traffic began to ease and the white salt flats dropped away from view Steve eventually turned back to me and said, 	“I always had it in the back of my mind that you killed him?”	“Killed who?” I asked back, somewhat surprised by the line of questioning and wondering inside he was referring to our father. Even if I was the one to broach the subject in the first place. It really wasn’t a place I wanted to go - so I said.	“You talking about dad?”	“No you idiot. That cunt who stole that temporary road system I built - after I heard his shoulder was out when they found him. First person I thought of was you. Arthur, that old prick, love him. He could never have done that even if he wanted to.”	“Is that right?”	“Yeah, and after seeing you carrying on last night with your shit - I’d say, I’m right.”	“you trying to ruin your buddies retirement plan?” 	“No.”	“Well why say shit like this then when there’s no point as you know I was over a thousand miles away when it happened?”	Turning his head away again Steve waited a moment as he stared. Then almost to himself, he said, 	“thousand miles or a thousand foot, you always was a sneaky fuck.”Then he stayed silent as we bumped along. Steve staring at the endless businesses that lined the highway. Their Grande designed signs either holding strong, or long since abandoned to their fate. Huge advertising hoardings so large they could be visible from space, monoliths rising up into the air from scrubland with weeds doing their utmost to lay claim and pull the huge steel structures back down to earth. All displaying smooth light skinned beautiful Thai’s with brilliant shiny white teeth. Another hour past before he spoke again, saying,	“That weekend that shit head Clive went missing. You said you were partying all night in Calgary. Dad used to say if you are out past three am then you’re either doing drugs or fucking, which one was it with you?”Dad again.	      “Well he should know.” I said almost to myself. 	“you don’t do drugs, so which one was it?” Steve asked.       “None of your business, is what it is.” I answered. Then he sat there again, as another ten minutes went by. Something was coming, I could tell, having seen it all before. The guy building up the courage inside to hit me with a heavy weight glove of some sort. It was the way he was. Then it came,	      “you’re a single guy in Pattaya with over what, twenty - thirty thousand girls who want you to fuck them?”      “and?” I answered.       “And, and, I was thinking…. That you’re not a party guy, you’re a fucking loony tunes…..” I waited a moment, taking that one in. Then waited some more for a truck to pass me in the fast lane and watched as the black smoke from its exhaust smothered us.      “Is that right?” I answered with a smile as I looked to the back of my brothers head as he twisted away from me and spoke into the blackened glass of the window.       “Yeah,” Steve replied as he looked back around and stared right into the side of my face as I drove, I said.       “I’m not interested in women? What about those girls last night when you ‘saved me’?”      “That don’t count, those girls must have seduced you or gave you magic potion or something. That aint you…… If you had not of killed that prick in Grande Prairie then Arthur wouldn’t be in prison now and he would have been here with me and maybe he’d have seen that something was wrong.”             Fuck me that was a stretch.             I sat there and took that one in as I listened to the roar from the hollowed out exhaust pipe beneath me. How the fuck could he now be making it my fault because this girl he was in love with was a whore and he’d missed the signs? I wasn’t even here? And on top of that, everything he was saying was just speculation. Saying that I’d left that fuck that had ripped him off for dead under his temporary wooden road blocks. Which I had. Paying a bar maid a thousand dollars to buy drinks throughout the night all weekend on my credit card then stealing a nice comfortable car from the long stay carpark at Calgary airport. Driving all the way up to the oil sands, finding this Clive guy out on the temporary road and removing his arm from its socket, making the prick admit what he’d done. Then watching the guy die of a heart attack and fall under the same piece of road Steve owned that the man was trying to lay. Leaving him there in mud for someone else to find then hearing later he was missing and thinking someone must come along later and not seen him and just lowered the huge road piece onto his body. I said again, knowing full well that Steve was somewhat half right.      “So that’s what happened?”      “Yeah, I think so.”      “well, think what you want and in a few years’ time - once reality has set in you’ll realise having your old buddy Arthur here with you would never have saved you, and you only have yourself to blame for your own stupid actions.”       “Like killing a guy by throwing him out of a window – that kind of stupid? Or are you talking about something way more stupid like meeting a girl, falling in love and wanting to get married? Which stupid action would you say is the one you’d most likely regret?”      I took the car out of the middle lane and overtook a truck who thought it was okay to drive slow in traffic with what had to be a produce store complete with wife and daughter working in the rear. Then I said,       “Depends who you talk to.” Which in my eyes was a fair point as either one could ruin your life. How many stories had I personally heard of woe, both male and female, where one party has been royally fucked by some sociopath. Yes of course for me, there had been girls. Some I’d dated and slept with and enjoyed, others I had not. None I’d met though I could say that I’d liked enough to allow them to fuck up my life. I said,      “just be thankful you didn’t get her pregnant.”      Steve looked away and thought about that one. The young man sitting there in the bucket seat with his itchy back. Then he said.      “Girls can’t get pregnant if you pull out.”                       				***************            I sat there in silence and drove for a while. Looking at the stray dogs that wandered or simply lay at the side of the road. Some sleeping, others just staring at the traffic as it filed by. All tempting death. Looking to one who seemed to have escaped just that as it hobbled along with one rear leg smashed for good.       “What’s the deal with all the dogs.” I asked, breaking the silence. Steve staring at one and then another and then waited until we passed a third before he answered.      “Strays.”             Well fuck me there’s a revelation…..       I then looked at my brother as though he was one himself.       “Really is that what they are?”      “Yeah,” Steve answered, the guy speaking now with authority. “Sherri says they’re tough as old boots. Sherri says they survive off whatever comes their way.”            Sherri…. good old Sherri.       The girl some sort of road dog herself with the way she was taking herself through life it seemed.      “She’d know.” I answered.We carried on with Steve staying quiet again after that little nugget of truth came rolling out. Then as a truck dragging a trailer nearly took us off the road doing a U turn in the highways centre. The noisy truck with its gaudy painted décor making us break hard and slide the car to the hard shoulder to miss it, I said.       “Fuck me, I thought it was just Alberta that was stupid enough to allow U turns on highways?”      Tilting his head down, Steve stared as the truck with its rows of wing mirrors lining each door, the mirrors crammed in rows that would make many a mod in the 60’s on route to Brighton stand to attention. Watching as the truck then pushed another driver onto the hard shoulder, Steve said,       “I’d have thought with all those mirrors he’d be able to see he was about to kill someone?”      “Maybe that’s the point.” I said, “Maybe the only difference between here and Alberta is that here they’re possibly trying to kill you on purpose.”             					****************		   	Around three hours later we were in the city of Hua Hin on the east coast of southern Thailand. Cruising noisily along the main road and passing the King’s palace with its neatly uniformed armed guards and manicured lawns. We hit the centre of town and half an hour later I found myself sitting in the sun at the side of the grandiose centre piece fuck you swimming pool of the Hilton.	“Remind me what we are doing here?”I asked Steve as we sat there feet up beer in hand on two of the many loungers that surrounded the blue tiled pool. 	“Sherri’s friend works here.”	“You should have switched girlfriends, at least the one here has a job,”	“Sherri had a job.”      Yeah - screwing men over for money. Then trying to think of a more diplomatic and better way to put it, I said. 	“Yeah screwing men over for money.”Unable to argue the point, Steve got up and walked away, disappearing in amongst the rows of tourists laying on their sunbeds soaking up the rays. Maybe it was as hard for him to disagree as it was for me to keep my mouth shut. 	I ordered a beer, and then another. Knocking that back, I ordered another, and then another, and after what had to be the eighth I awoke in a twin room in the early hours of the morning, naked on the bed with only my phone whose battery was as dead as the brain cells I’d destroyed. 	I looked to the balcony door. It was open. The lights from the large pool drifting up from below. The sound of the waves coming in from the ocean crashing upon the soft powdered sand. Grabbing my shorts I looked up to the air conditioner as it hummed away trying to cool a room with a large hole in its centre which leaked in eighty degree air. 	Then I saw Steve’s feet and realized he must be sleeping out on a recliner on the balcony. But he couldn’t have been asleep as without moving I heard him say, 	“For fuck sake, make your mind up will you? If you’re not snoring you’re fucking talking.”   	“I don’t snore.” I answered as I still wondered what he was doing out there. Stepping out onto the balcony I looked down at the pool. The underwater lights beaming out, skimming the blue tiles and mosaic paintings of dolphins carefully crafted upon its bottom. The rolling sea in the distance dropping to black as the reach of the flood lights faded.  	“I haven’t said anything?” I answered him confused.  Steve saying as he raised his hands and placed them behind his head.       “I suppose you weren’t talking to that girl either.” Looking at him I wondered what he was speaking about. 	“What girl?”Steve then closed his eyes. 	“Fuck me, you really need to stop drinking…..”	“I don’t know what you’re talking about?”	“Here’s a life tip - Don’t do sex talk with a ladyboy when your brothers out on the balcony.” 	“What are you talking about?” I asked,“All I can say is two things - I’ve never heard you so happy even if you were telling her that you thought she was a guy.”Oh god…. 	“And I’ve never been so happy when someone’s phone battery died.” He was correct with regard the phone, I’d give him that, but for the life of me I did not remember talking to anyone.	“Who the fuck was that anyway? Not that girl I see sucking you off in that bar was it?”It wasn’t, far from it.The vague memory of May laughing down the phone came wandering back into my mind. 	“One thing you can do.” Steve then said. “Is function whilst drunk, I’ll tell you that. Although I’m sure that girl who’s toes were hanging over the edge of her platformed shoes is not to happy you can.”      I felt the warm breeze wash past me as I stood there staring at my brother.  	“You told her she had feet like an Octopus.”	“Who?” I asked, hoping the answer wasn’t May.	“Sherri’s friend.” Thank fuck for that. 	“I didn’t?”	“You did.”Fuck,I know I cannot control what I say, so it was possible. But it was usually when someone annoyed me. I asked.	“Did she piss me off?”	“Yeah she said you were a fat cunt.”I looked at my stomach. I suppose there was a chance this could be how I was seen by people. But it would be a stretch. Leaving Steve alone with himself on the balcony I slid the glass door closed as I walked back into the bedroom and by the time I’d sat myself on the bed, he’d opened it again with his foot. I said,	“I thought you’d had enough of me?”	“I have,” Steve said back to me with a grin.  “I just wanted to know what you thought of Sherri’s friend.”I gave that one some thought, and tried to wrack my brain for some sort of answer, but truth was I had no clue.	“She’s got big toes?” I said in a vain hope I could disguise the lush that deep down I knew I must be.	“See I can see through your bullshit amnesia thing all the time.”	“Is that a fact?” I asked. Then followed it up with. “So what did she say about this fucking leach who’s running about with the money you owe me?”	“Say’s she still loves me and it was her husband who set us up.”	“Us?”	“Me, then. But you know what I mean – she said, yeah, she’s married but she’s not with the guy anymore. Somehow though he still stole the money from her – then she ran because she thought I wouldn’t believe her.”	“Well she got that bit right.”Steve stayed quiet for a moment, the man twitching his toes back and forth as he laid there in the warm night air. Then he said.	“you didn’t need to be rude to her you know – she’s done nothing to us.”	“call her then and tell her I’m sorry. Tell her I’ll buy her a pedicure.” I answered as a vision of a heavily made up woman crying in her shoes that did not fit drifted into my mind. Carrying on I said, “and while you’re at it, ask her why, the last time you saw her, she didn’t mention that the woman you were marrying was already taken?”	“I asked her about that – she said it was a Buddhist marriage so it didn’t count.”	“Is that right? Doesn’t count?”	“legally yeah. It don’t count, a condo lease has more value. ”Then we sat in silence. The water in the distance smashing against the sand and rocks with endless rhythm and unable to help myself I said. 	 “Well if you find a new girl, make sure she’s Muslim. Those guys take it seriously.”	      ******************      The next day I found myself sitting opposite this Sherri’s friend, and for some reason all I seemed to be able to do was stare at her feet. The woman sitting there all miffed, looking just as I’d seen her in my pickled mind the previous evening a few hours earlier. 	We’d done breakfast at the Hilton in amongst the same families I’d seen hanging around the pool. Blonde Scandinavian parents martialing blue eyed kids, as they stuffed their plates with food they would never finish. Older European men sitting alone or beaming unbelievable happiness in the company of their new Thai wives or girlfriends half their age. These men now free it seemed from whatever they’d have gone through in life and now sitting there exuding joy. 	And here in this tiny labyrinth of bars I found myself in I was seeing it again as other retired decent looking men in their seventies walked hand in hand with their Thai women. Without looking up Steve said, 	“They must not sell wife beater shirts here?”And he wasn’t wrong there, as like him I’d only seen the single men who frequented the town mostly wearing either proper expensive T’s or collared shirts, designer or tailor made. Steve then said,	“Is it me or is everyone here just happy?”The men were, there was no doubting that. The place being some kind of oasis of love. And on that note I thought about May again, and wondered what I’d maybe been saying the night before back in the hotel room as I run up the establishments electricity bill. Something, no doubt that I’d embarrass myself with. I looked down again and stared at the toes of this girl who was Sherri’s friend. Her toes hanging over the side of her platform shoes like snakes dropping down off a curbstone.  Her nails nicely polished and pedicured matching the manicure she’d no doubt paid well for. The women saying straight back at me as I stared.	“What you stare at feet?”I like your nails, say that…. Just say that.	“Your toes look like snakes.” Fuck! I looked to the women who was doing her best to understand what I meant.	“Beautiful snakes.” Steve then said as he looked again to me with daggers. Then the women asked.      “you think I steal money? I work.”      “Where is she then – Where’s this Sherri work?” I asked.      “I good woman,” She then said. And I’m sure she was, even if by the looks of things she was selling her tail of an evening. I’d seen worse. The woman no doubt just here like the rest supporting her kids and everyone else on the family tree, not like back in Grande Prairie or the any other towns surrounding the tar sands. Places where some women sold tail and sucked dickand blew it all on coke. Women who in some men’s drunken stupor had looked like angels only to show their true ugly selves when their wings came off. I said,       “I’m sorry, I’ve got this thing where I can’t control what I say.”      “Yes you brother said you retard.” The girl said straight back. Touché, and I suppose I was in some manner. There was little doubt. Getting back on point and glancing to Steve, I said,      “ you need to tell me where we can find the love of my brother’s life before he commits hari kari.”      “I not understand?”      “Where Sherri?” I asked.      “Not know?”      “Is she with husband?”The woman, looked to Steve and then back to me. Then said,      “Not know.”      “What do you know?” I said in frustration. The woman knew but she just wasn’t saying. I needed to be softer, try somehow get on her good side. So I said.      “Look - We’re not here for head, we’re just trying to find Steve’s fiancé.”                  And understanding my words exactly, getting up, she said.      “You ass hoo! This, I know this.”And with that she was up and off with her toes leading the way. Feeling Steve’s glare I looked over to him.      “What?”      “That’s Sherri’s friend.”      “You talking about the same woman who stole my money?”      “We don’t know that. Pimmy says Sherri wouldn’t have been involved.”            “Pimmy - who the fucks Pimmy?             Taking a guess I asked as I pointed my thumb to the door.      “That girls name was Pimmy?”It was. Then as the frustration welled up within, I asked Steve.      “How the fuck could your ‘fiancé’ not have been involved? She was the one you gave the money to.” Steve stared at the floor. The tiles now wiped clean from the beer and food that had found its way south the previous evening. He said,      “Maybe it was this guy who got access to it?”      “This guy being – Sherri’s husband?”      “Like I said - They were never married properly.”      But that never stopped her from fucking the guy when he went swimming.      But that was something best not said. So I said instead.      “married or not she was still fucking the guy every morning you went for a swim.” Steve stared at me as he heard the words leave my lips, the man completely unfazed and showing zero emotion to what I’d just told him.       “She wasn’t.” He simply said.      “Really?” I answered, the tone of my voice resembling now our mother after we’d just denied destroying the lawn out back with our bikes.       “Yeah.” Steve said, “That grey haired prick was full of shit, because every day I went swimming, Sherri went swimming with me. She never missed a day.”                  				***************                  We moved on, heading south. The roads easing in intensity with every mile. The souped up Honda Civic seemingly noisier now than it had ever been. The seats making Steve’s back itch more than mine.       Sherri it turned out was on an island called Koh Samui. And it was information that had taken a long long time to discover. Now, I can tell you, it’s not what you’re thinking. This time around there was no need for Jiu Jitsu arm bars. No one fell to their death via a window. The information of the love of my brother’s life whereabouts had come from a simple money transaction made after we’d eventually tracked this girl down so as I could apologize.             Myself feeling the guilt, as some of this Pimmy’s conversation the night before filtered back through my pickled mind. My inner soul for some reason now slightly stinging after being called an ‘ass hoo’ as we’d drifted from bar to bar. Even if it had not been the first time I’d ever suffered such indignation. Far from it, I had after all spent almost my entire working life on the oil fields. But coming in such an honest way from a young lady who despite her occupation of choice was still pure of heart her words for me seemed to have dug deep and stung.       Eventually we’d tracked the lady down and found her as she sat with friends one block away. The woman standing as she saw us. Shooing us away as we approached with her hands and words as though we were street dogs. Myself, placing my hands together in what felt to me like a Christian prayer and waying in apology to the girl as she did. Holding my thumbs to my chin and bowing my head slightly in the manner I’d seen now so many other Thai’s do. The girl, this Pimmy, the friend of this siren who had stolen my brothers heart excepting my actions as just that sitting herself down at the side of an empty booth and gesturing for us to join her.       Then after, once her purse was full from all the money I could pull from Steve and my pockets there seemed nothing the women would not tell me about this friend she claimed to have. Myself sitting there in a corner booth of the bar she’d ran and hid from us in. The money that I’d discreetly taken out and handed gently to her. Maybe a month or so’s wage. A wage she’d have earned after parting company with a lot of false smiles and laughs, and putting up with bad breath and drunken gropes, which she now would not have to contend with, if she wished. At least for a while that is. She said,      “Sherri my friend, she like your brother - husband not my friend. He bad man.”And with these words the man’s walls began to tumble. The husband it turned out was not Thai but was in fact from Lao’s. The man having knocked up Steve’s girl then later married her, at the young age of seventeen. Not a week short of the happy couples young boys fifth birthday. 	Now hang on! I hear you say as you quickly do the maths, and any disconcert you feel is not at all wrong. Teenage pregnancy is though common all around the world, these things happen. I myself had seen my fair share, despite the time spent trying to eradicate it by all the education authorities in Canada and other first world countries. And Thailand is no exception. There was something off though and there was a niggling suspicion inside me that was telling me there was possibly more to this story than I was being told. 					Chapter Five           	     We picked a place on the beach in Bang Saphan away from the main town. The area quiet and rich in coconut groves. Rows and rows of seasoned palms reaching up to the sky. Each coveting their plush and heavy load of seeds. Workers drifting about with their small teams of trained monkeys who sat quietly in the side cars of their motorbikes. Each one waiting excitedly for the next opportunity to be let free to climb the towering palms and drop the harvest down to earth.  	“So this is where she’s from eh?” I asked Steve as he peeled himself from the front of the car. 	“So she said.”	“you think her dad did this shit, you think he had himself a monkey team?” I asked as we passed another worker with his small team of primates looking like little people as they sat on the edge of the side car. Carrying and not waiting for Steve to answer and despite the fact I was in the full knowledge that my brother was correct. I said,	“Maybe she was full of shit?”  	“No - She’s from here - I know it. The women here look different from the ones up north. They got different noses.” 	“Is that right?”	“Yeah.” Steve answered, nodding. “Their noses are different. I been looking. You just got to look at that Pimmy girl and you can see.” Laughing I said.	“One stop off at 7–11 and now you an anthropologist?” Not bothering to answer, Steve walked towards the small beach hut I’d just paid for in cash. The accommodation situated right on the beach, with its nice verandah and stairs that dropped down onto the sand. He looked to the sea with its waves lapping the beach.	“If there’s a tsunami, we’re fucked.”	“If?” I answered as I looked out at the ocean.“Yeah if,” Steve said as he opened the door, and quickly laid claim to the bed, dropping himself down onto the crib nearest the water. “If there’s one tonight. Don’t worry, I’ll be first to go.” 						****************      About an hour later, just as the sun was dropping in the west I walked the beach. My big work boots squeezing the soft sand with every step. The salt water lapping against their soles. I looked along the large stretch of golden sand which was for that moment mine and mine alone.       The seemingly endless breeze cooling me as it swayed. The tall palms stretching towards the water, waiting to shed their seed to the ocean. Tiny birds, running for stranded morsels of food left by the retreating tide. In the distance a bunch of dogs stood as they saw me approach. This man who was walking toward them in his cut-off jeans and big boots. This man who had no right to lay bare a claim to a beach and shoreline which was a territory they believed to be theirs and theirs alone. This one tiniest slivered section of a paradise which extended out and beyond the weather beaten picket fence bordering the garden of the dogs owners home and was public domain.       There were five in total, three Pit Bulls, one light brown, the other two black, a Thai street dog and a lovely happy Beagle with not a care in the world. The dogs leaving the beagle to just smile as they approached me as I came towards them. Their backs raised as the street dog began a ritual of incessant barking. The pit bulls simply waiting as if readied for my attack. The beagle watching seemingly just happy to be alive.        By the time I’d reached them I’d instinctively drifted out onto a sand bar as the dogs taking my retreat as a sign of weakness rushed through the shallow water with their legs and undersides splashing as they came. They hit the sandbank, and whipping around me I quickly found myself surrounded. The black Pitbull’s, now they were closer looking older than the lighter brown one with its nasty beady eyes as it skirted about on the sand. The fucking thing nipping at my ankles whilst other two waited and the street dog just barked. Kicking out with my right leg the brown dog jumped narrowly missing my heavy size elevens as they swung through the hot air. The dogs growling as they moved, circling me, as I continued to walk. The brown Pitbull becoming progressively braver and braver with every snap and snarl until with a twist of it’s body it connected. Sinking it’s teeth deep into the leather of my boot. The dog snarling and shaking it’s head as though it had caught a rat by the throat. Planting my right foot back down hard into the sand I bought my left up into the biting dogs ribs, sending it’s body for the moment airborne as the animal held on.       With my eye on the other two dogs as they grew closer, the brown dog, now winded from a second kick to the ribs, the quickly delivered smack to the chest from my left boot making the dog let go. The street dog jumping from side to side as it yapped spinning itself quickly away as the brown dog rolled past. I looked around me.            What I needed was a stick and a big one at that,But there were no sticks, conveniently washed up close by that I could Rambo off the ground and create my own havoc with. It was just me and me alone and what I really needed was not to be there at all.       Glad that it had only been my boot that the dog had bitten onto and not my barefoot, I moved on. Both myself and the dogs it seemed rattled from the foray. Breathing hard and watching my back, I ventured further along the sandy shore line. The palms standing proud at the beaches edge. Some stretching their necks towards the turquoise sea. It was there that I saw it in the distance just standing alone in the sand. The little puppy maybe just six weeks old looking lost as it cried. Reaching it, I sank down resting my ass on the heel of my size eleven boots and called for the little mutt to join me. Nervously the poor thing dropped back and cautiously stared as it span around and around in no doubt the hope that it’s mother would miraculously appear. Then as the never ending tide washed up upon the pure white sand, one wave freak in nature, born of a storm far out in the South China sea perhaps days before came sweeping in catching the little fella and taking him off his feet. Bowling him along the beaches sloping sand, his head under water and his paws kicking out at nothing. Then as quick as the wave pulled back out to sea another wave returned, the ocean dragging the puppy to and fro in the water with it’s never ending cycle of white bubbling foam.        Running into the water with the waves hitting my ass and soaking my jeans I leant down, scooping the little fella up as it instinctively tried to keep its head above water and rolled around in the surf. I looked down to the puppy. It’s frightened eyes, big and bulging as it gazed back at me. The young dogs fur pulled tight to its tiny body by the salt laden water. Smiling, I said to it as it stared back at me in terror.       “hello little fella, what you doing here?”                  				***************                  With the puppy still in tow and once again dodging the dogs, I made it back to the cabin by the water. The little dog now my friend for life as it lapped thirstily at the water and milk I’d poured into a dish that was solely meant for humans. He really was a lovely ‘little fella,’ so that’s what I named him. This beautiful happy little pup with its doughy eyes and soft nature. The puppy pulling on the laces of my still wet boots as it played. The little fella jumping for sticks I held just out of reach in my hands. The little fella now happily sleeping on my lap without a care in the world. Then Steve came home with a flea in his ear about something.       “There’s a dead dog up the beach.” Was all he said as he walked right passed me. The little fella still sleeping on my lap as I sat with my feet up on the bench swing that sat outside the door.       “Really?” I replied. “Yeah it’s in the water, surfs got it now though I’d say.” Then he saw the puppy laying there oblivious to the world on my lap.       “Where the fuck you find that?”      “It’s lost,” was all I answered,       “Well, unlost it then, go find it’s mum.”      “Maybe it’s mum is the dead dog you see floating out there.” Walking over, Steve stopped and looked at the puppy laying asleep on my lap.       “Maybe?” he answered, then said, “see I did you a favour in the end, you thought you come out here to rescue me and you ended up rescuing some little mutt instead.”       “Little fella’s his name.” I said correcting him quickly so as little mutt would never get the opportunity to stick.       “Well you better go out there and see for real if that dead dogs got milk titties so as you aint taking the mutt from its mum.” But there was no point in doing that as I already knew what dog it was floating out there on the surf. As I was the one who had killed it.             				*************            With the little fella drenched and still scrambling in my arms I’d turned and seen the brown Pitbull standing with his yappy street dog buddy in tow. The Pitbull staring at me from along the beach.       Ignoring the two dogs I’d sat down in the sand, cradling the little fella in my arms, as it struggled and coughed. It’s little claws scratching at the skin on my legs. His little white teeth biting at my fingers. Then the two dogs had come racing in with all their might, as I’d stood and held the little fella from their viciousness. The two dogs arriving with passion, skidding with their paws digging small channels in the sand. The street dog yapping excitedly, the young brown Pitbull moving around and around me as I walked back along the beach, it’s little beady eyes now only focused solely on taking the little puppy from my arms.       Then as I neared the dogs home it became bolder and had begun to jump. It’s strong ferocious teeth snapping as I’d turned away pushing the dog back with my hips. Hitting the sand the dog moved around to my front and again jumped, it’s front paws scratching my thighs as it came. With another blow from my size elevens I’d sent it rolling away as the dogs back hit the sand. The dog quickly twisting its body, getting to its feet, as it came again. The vicious mutt  possessed with some demonic need as it circled me over and over, until it struck once more. With a free hand I’d let a fist fly catching the monster in the side of its head and caught it with another boot to the ribs as it fell away. Then as soon as it hit the ground it was up again, snarling and jumping unrelentingly as it snapped at my legs and midriff whilst I held the puppy away. I’d moved myself towards the ocean, the waves hitting the back of my calves as the dogs splashed around me. The street dog just yapping as it whipped back and forth. The brown Pitbull continuing to attack. I’d stepped back again, until the waves hit my knees, the Pitbull charging forward snapping at my legs and feet as I held the puppy away from its snapping jaw and kicked back in defence. Then the dog dropped down, and with a surge of pure rage sprang at me through the water, biting down the top of my hip as I span away to protect myself. The dog this time getting purchase with its jaw and teeth, clamping it’s self into my cut down jeans and clasping it’s front incisors into the flesh on my hip. Falling back I hit the water. The waves now smashing around above my head. With one hand I held the little fella out of the surf as my other grabbed the ruff of the Pitbull’s neck and held it there under the water as I fell. With both legs wrapped around the dogs torso and the other holding firm onto the dogs neck I felt it let go it’s grip to my side and unable to breathe began to kick and struggle in the surf stirring up the sand on the oceans shallow bed until eventually it went still.                 				**************      “No either way I think I’ll keep it.” I said, already having made up my mind after having saved the little fella’s life twice that morning I felt it was fate for us both to meet.       “How? You can’t keep it here, they don’t do pets.” Steve protested in a manner that any one hearing him would assume he was an authority on hotel policy in the area.       “He’s not a pet - he’s a puppy.”       “You gonna take him back to Canada then?”      “Absolutely.” I answered even though with regard planning the dogs future, in truth, I hadn’t got much further than a bowl of milk. 					*************      With my new found companion we hit the road again. The little fella tucked up on my lap as I took our new noisy car with its itchy seats and supercharged engine out onto the highway. Steve there looking down at my boots as my feet danced on the pedals whilst I switched gears. Me feeling the bruise from the dog bite on my hip with every thrust of my foot.      “I reckon you killed that dog.” Steve then said.      “What dog?” I asked doing my best to sound confused.      “You know.”      “Why’d you say that?” I then asked still trying to sound surprised as I looked to my brother and then down at the little fella on my lap.       “Just know what you’re like, that’s all. That and the fact you got teeth marks in those wet boots you always wearing and there’s scratches on your legs and there’s something up with your hip.”      “You a pet detective? One of them RSPCA gumshoe investigator guys now are you?” I asked him as I shifted lanes dropping behind a truck which once again seemed to be carrying twice the load it was designed for. Steve saying,      “Somethings not right, I know that. You going to be getting us in trouble out here carrying on with your shit like you do.”       “I never touched that dog, for fuck sake!” I answered  “The dog probably just drowned or something.”       “How you know it drowned?” He snapped back.       “Well, for one, you said it was in the water on a beach! So forgive me for assuming. It’s not like he would have been hit by a fucking car is it?”       “How do you know it was a male dog.”      “I don’t.” I answered back in a deniability tone I’d perfected ever since I’d began killing insects as a kid. Then in silence we sat for a bit. Myself looking to the road trying to stay alive. Steve looking to the little fella. Unable to stop myself I simply said.       “Maybe you spend as much time looking at the games and moves that chick was playing as you have working out the final moments of some fuckhead dog then the vicious fucker would never have got itself drowned?”       “So you did kill it? You fuck!” Steve snapped back at me in somewhat surprise. And being completely and utterly honest I told him the truth.      	“No.”             				***************      About an hour later and fully fed on gas station market chicken and milk for the pup, we hit traffic. The car moving noisily along the highway until things slowed and I down shifted to a crawl behind a procession of cars which crept forward towards a police check. The motorcade of vehicles one after an another slowing as they filed into a single line only to be stopped long enough for the police men in their tight brown uniforms to lean down, look inside, and wave the car forward.        “Maybe they looking for bad guys.” Steve said as he watched the police release car after car after car until they eventually came to us, but they weren’t looking for bad guys, they were looking for us.             				****************       	I sat in a hot and stuffy police station with it’s inadequate air conditioning. The palms outside swaying in the breeze. A police man in his starched tight brown uniform emblazed with decorative ribbon sown into his shirt just above his heart stood now before me. The man wandering about the room squawking bad English that genuinely made little sense. Saying words such as “Papers? Passport? Hotel? Visa?” Along with a host of other shit I’d long given up trying to understand. It had to be about the guy who’d killed himself accidently falling out the window back in Pattaya. And no doubt the police in charge up there in Pattaya where wanting answers. So knowing only too well most people sitting in prison put themselves there, I simply said again for what must have been the fifth time.       “Where’s puppy, puppy needs his milk?”      “Puppieeeee….. Pupieeeee….Gin…. Gin…. No worryyyy… ” The man replied as he walked back and forth in the small room, his boots gleaming with shine, the chromed metal kick plates on the inside of each heal catching the sun beaming it’s rays onto the floor.        Just as the fourth hour passed I finished another water and wondered if they had Steve sitting there sweating in another room also. And if so whether they were stupid enough to think that he was about to start blabbing. Then the door opened and another man came in, placed both hands in front of himself ‘wayed’ me and then sat down on the other side of the desk.       His name was Soone. Soone Jungumang to be exact, and it turned out he’d driven all the way from Pattaya just to speak with me.       “What makes me so special for you to have you come all the way down here to see me?” I asked, as I sat there staring at the man as he sat opposite. The man looking fly, with his fresh haircut and designer clothes. In perfect English he replied. 	“Oh, it’s my penance for studying so hard at university. Now whenever there’s someone of interest, guess who gets the call?”       He was Tourist Police. The worst type of cop, I’m told. But from what I had seen so far, the guy didn’t seem so bad. Maybe it was his way, maybe he was the ‘good’ in the good cop bad cop scenario, and he had a not so clean cut miserable fuck of a buddy waiting in the hall. I asked, getting straight to the point. 	“Is this the norm for tourists who are trying to enjoy their stay in your country?” 	“Depends if they’ve been on a killing spree I suppose, but no, not normally. Just people around here tend to get a little sensitive about their pets.”            Oh! So that was it. It wasn’t about the loser who’d accidently fallen out of the window of some brothel, it was all about a fucking vicious dog which should have learned to swim. Without batting an eye, I replied,       “What the fuck you talking about?” And Soone Jungumang replied.	“There’s a nice Canadian man lives on the water with his family - spent some money on some pure breed dogs, everyone in the family got to pick their favourite I’m told. Turns out his favourite drowned.	      “Is that right?” I asked. 	“Apparently.”	“And when was this supposed to have happened?.”	“This morning.”	“You come all the way down from Bangkok because some dog can’t swim?”	“Pattaya actually, and… No.”	“Then what the fuck you talking about?”	“This German man is saying you drowned it. Said it was just playing and you kicked it and dragged the poor little thing into the ocean?” I gave that one some thought. Playing, really…. playing? The poor little thing - Tell that to the bite mark on my thigh. So I answered,       “Go tell that to the guy who did it because it wasn’t me. Maybe when you find him he’ll fess up to the other dozen dead dogs I saw laying in the kerb on the way down here.” 	“So you’re saying it wasn’t you?” 	“Your English is pretty good?” I answered. And the man’s English was good, as good as mine I have to say. And there was no reason it shouldn’t have been considering Soone Jungumang had been brought up by a British step father who’d met his mother whilst teaching English at a school in Bangkok and decided to stay. He said,       “The man’s saying he watched you do it, along with other witnesses.”	“Oh really?”	“Yes.”	“Well, all us white guys look the same I’m told.”	“Not like you they don’t…. You were staying at a hotel on the beach?”	“Yes but who knows if it was the same beach this dog discovered it could not swim.”	“And the guy who killed the dog had a puppy, and you’ve got a puppy?”	“So’s my mum, but she didn’t drown the dog either.”Soone then walked to the other side of the room and stared out of the window as though there was something else on his mind. Turning back he said. 	“Your brother has told us it was you.” That one I laughed openly about. Fuck me, good luck with that. This guy was going to have to try harder. How many times throughout my life so far had some prick, be it school teachers, headmasters, cops, or any other fucker who’d believed they had the chops to get in between my brother and myself. Even if he was an idiot, only to find out in the end they’d failed. I said. 	“Is that right?”	“No, not exactly. But he did just swap your car for a bottle of water so as you both could get on your way.”       With that, I sat there just stunned.             He’d done what?             And that is exactly what I said. The Thai tourist policeman who spoke perfect English, saying back with a smile.	“Yeah he said he was thirsty and I’m a sucker for hot rod Civics you know. Shame for you your brother isn’t, says the seats make his back itch.”      I sat there for a moment taking it all in. What the fuck had that stupid fuck Steve done now? Why the fuck would he do that? Fuck!Okay, so the shit head dog problem was solved, but there may not have been a problem anyway had he just kept quiet. Then Soone Jungumang said as he stood there with a big stupid grin across his face. 	“So you can either go hire one if you want from in town, or buy yourself another from a dealer, either way you’ll be needing new wheels so you can get on your way. But before I let you go you need to tell me about that guy you threw out the window in Pattaya.” Chapter SixSo now we had a big SUV, with plenty of space in the back for the little fella, who wasn’t really ready for that yet and seemed content sitting on my lap. The nice white car coming from a car sales centre sitting at the side of the highway. Steve said, as we carried on along the number four highway heading south. 	“These things are heavy on gas you know, you should have got something smaller.”	“You just gave our small car away?” I replied in astonishment at the man’s accusation.      “Typical you - thanks for nothing. Get you out of trouble and then I get shit for it.”      “I wasn’t in trouble.” I answered back as I stared out at the road, the huge Buddha trees lining the side of the highway Their tall leaves sheltering the hard shoulder to its side where motorcyclists rode the wrong way against the traffic and stray dogs lay next to locals selling their wares. All hiding from the unforgiving sun.      And it wasn’t a lie, I wasn’t in trouble. Far from it actually, but we’ll get into that later. The guy Soone, making the precarious journey south on a four hour trip after hearing two Farang’s had been pulled up and taken into custody whilst driving a piece of shit hot rod car just purchased in Pattaya a day earlier.       “I’m not the one who killed that dog.” Steve said, now pissed at me as per usual.       “Neither am I.” I told him without hesitation. It shouldn’t have gone in the ocean if it couldn’t swim.”      “How do you know it drowned in the ocean?”      “it didn’t drown on the bath did it? Anyway we already been through this.”Then Steve sat quietly, the man looking out the window at the view for what seemed an age. Out of nowhere, he then said.  	“It’s the kind of shit you do.” He looked to the little fella now laying asleep upon my lap.	“Kill shit then deny it, make it like it was whoever’s dead’s fault.”	“Is that right?”	“Yeah - I’m surprised I’ve made it this far.” Ignoring him, I carried on heading south. The road getting worse with its increasingly frequent potholes and ripped up tarmac. Our SUV for the moment taking it well. The fields either side of the road loaded with palms. Stretching up from the earth becoming larger and more frequent. The mountains laying to our right covered in trees choked with vegetation. Directions for the Myanmar border that now ran just the other side laying way to newly paved road digging deep into a valley. Staring at the border sign as we passed, Steve eventually said.  	“You think she’s gone there and that girl with the toes is full of shit?”	“Why’d she go there? People from here don’t go there, they come here - from there.”	“You the expert on Thailand now are you - been here two minutes?”	“Why’d she go there?” I asked again.	“Might be nice.”	“It’s not.”	“Who says?” Steve asked.	“Country’s in civil war, they say.”	“Really?”Then he looked at the mountains again blocking the view of whatever version of civil war his mind was conjuring up.	      “Don’t see no smoke?”      “Some of it is – maybe not right here.”      “What you saying there’s killing and shit going on, bombs and tanks and stuff?” The man then looked back towards the road and nodding. Seemingly relieved that maybe a stray missile of some sort wasn’t spinning crazily out of control towards us from across the border.         “Maybe?”      “Fuck, who’d have thought. Shit like that just across the way, right on your doorstep. We’re driving down here worrying about stray dogs, them lot over the other side of that hill worrying about a fucking howitzer. You know what though, maybe that’s what this is all about. Sherri, she’s some sort of freedom fighter? She’s like that, can’t stand cops, sticks up for women and stray dogs and shit.”       I looked at him for the moment, then took my gaze back onto the road ahead and waited. The kid was still looking for any reason he could cling to so as he could legitimise what had happened. Other than the one that was staring him straight in the face. But he was my brother so  I’d give him that to cling to. So I said,       “Yeah, that’ll be it – she’s a freedom fighter alright, a financial freedom fighter though would be the correct analogy, I think. I doubt that the woman’s George Clooney’s missus’s cousin, put it that way. More like she’s just some kind of cock sucking fucking con artist whore.”					**************      We then sat in silence for another half hour after that one. Steve pouting again. Staring out the window. Eventually he took a deep breath and said,	“Why you always got to be like that? We were having a nice happy conversation about civil war and stuff, and you have to go getting your little digs in.”      “Happy conversation about revolutionary war and people getting blown up?” I answered.      “You know what I mean.” I did, there was no doubting that, how often, before that strange little gay man had come crashing into our world had we all sat as a family and watched Rambo or some shit like that and been entertained. Now though some rabid dog gets itself stuck under a pair of size elevens and the worlds in uproar. 	“You’re a trouble maker.” Steve then said in disgust. 	“Me?” I said in surprise. Knowing only too well that trouble had always seemed to find me wherever I went. 	“Yeah, it’s what you do. You got a big mouth. How would you like it I say something like that to you?”	“Like what?” I asked confused.	“Say if I said that woman, that coug you were fucking in west van was a whore?”That coug I had been fucking in West Van.Well he wasn’t wrong there. I’d been doing that. The woman now divorced taking a fancy to me after we’d met in a Calgary bar. The woman celebrating some shit on a long weekend with her older woman friends with their stretched out skin. 	“I’d say you were right!” I answered. Knowing the woman I’d once upon a time been in a relationship with, if that’s what I could call it, lived solely off the back of an ex-husband and had not done a stroke of work in her entire life. Except get face lift after face lift as she drove around in her new Tesla and turned herself into some sort of coffee house dwelling lizard. I said.       “If you had reason – I’d take it – same as you should.” But he wasn’t wrong - I did have a big mouth, that was true, but what came out of this big mouth I had was never anything less than correct – but the truth can be hard to take for a lot of people and Steve had in that regard always found a seat in the front row.       Maybe I did need to tone it possibly down, somehow give the guy a break. If I could. Him falling in love for the first time and all that, then quickly having his heart broken after couldn’t be easy. I said. 	“Don’t blame me because you’re a stupid cunt.” Then before he could pick himself off the floor my phone rang and it was May. 	“Hey!” she said, the young women’s voice like caramel sinking through soft whipped cream. 	“Hey?” I answered, my voice somehow raising and octave and sounding now like someone even I did not recognize myself. 	“What you doing?” Without a look to my brother, I kept on looking to the road as I drove and tucked the phone under my ear. 	“Just heading south to Samui with Steve, chatting about stuff. Catching up, you know.”	“That’s nice.”Then like a kid who’d just got a new toy, I told her.	“I got a puppy.”	“Really?”	“Yeah, found it on the beach, lost.”	“You look for its mum?”	“Yeah, coarse.” I lied, “Went right up and down, asked people and stuff.”	“The locals would know if there was a litter - Maybe someone dropped it off, they do that, usually though, they leave them at a temple.”	“I think it’s fate.” I said truthfully. “Might have drowned if I’d not been there.”Watching Steve shake his head in disbelief out the corner of my eye I carried on. 	“Waves were coming right up on the beach.”	“Have you a name for it yet?”	“Little fella,”	“Male then right – good – no pups to worry about - What about when you leave for Canada?” Canada – yes Canada. Now that was something as of yet I hadn’t thought about, let alone my return. I said.	“I’ll buy him the seat next to mine.”	“You think he can take the cold?” 	“Yeah dogs like it there, all that fur they got – besides they sell coats for em if it gets too cold.”Then May asked.	“Have you found your brothers fiancé yet?”	“No, maybe she’ll turn up in Samui.”	“Maybe?  I do know someone who will be there.”	“Who?” I answered.	“My sister, and me, if you’re interested?”I sat there and thought about that one for a second. I had not met the sister, but May had said herself the girl was a smoke show, even if there was chance she had a dick.	“Could be interesting?” I answered, and without another word, May quickly said. 	“Come to the Mai Thai arena in Chaweng on Tuesday, there’s a huge event fight. I’ll be there.”Then before I could ask where or say another word, May said. 	“And don’t worry - I won’t be hard to find.”				*****************      We made the ferry just after two. With the little fella on my lap and my ass planted firmly on a bench I’d found in the shade. I then sat and felt the sea breeze drift across my body as I watched the white water churn away from the boats stern. I was still amazed at the way things had gone so far for me since I’d arrived in this wonderful country. A lovely girl who seemed to have little agenda other than just wanting to be with me. A lovely little dog who seemed much the same, a nice new car. A police officer who’d gone out of his way to shake my hand after I’d thrown a man out a window and killed some guys dog. Had I had the same encounters back in Alberta I’d probably be in jail or with herpes or both. But not here in this magical kingdom where the sun always shines. Not here in the ‘land of smiles.’       The cop Soone whatever his name was, had been cool. The man standing there with his back to the door, in his nicely starched designer clothes making me feel like some sort of derelict. The man telling me how he’d been watching that silver haired fox for some time until he’d dropped down and landed at his feet. The man thinking prior that my brother and I had been doing deals with him up in that room. The man about to have us put on a watch list they’d been compiling. But no, not now. Now, I’d been made a renegade off shoot to their team.And I had a mission.					**************Koh Samui is an island and one of the jewels in Thailand’s crown. The place an elaborate mix of laid back tranquility with it’s pure white sand and crystal blue water which plays host to every kind of person this world has to offer.        It was around five in the afternoon when we arrived at the island’s Chaweng district. Parking the new SUV in the carpark of the hotel we picked there which sat at the edge of a beach covered in soft powdered sand stretching itself out into a clear turquoise blue water.       The water color I’d only ever beheld previously in lakes formed from the runoff of melting snow held captive by the unrelenting Rocky Mountains that had never seemed to be far from view throughout my life.       The room with its two double beds and another little deck that dropped down to the beach where vacationers swam and passed walking the shore line whilst the occasional noisy jet ski’s driven by equally noisy kids jumped waves in the distance. The little fella out there, racing around on the sand having quickly forgotten about the morning. Steve with a long face, saying as he watched the dog as it chased in circles at nothing. “Sherri likes dogs. That dogs fucked in the head though.” 	“You were young once.” I replied without looking up. But it was obvious these mood swings he was having was down to the fact that the man was love-struck and sulking. All Steve really needed was some inspirational motivational words of wisdom from someone who understood. So taking a deep breath I said.      “It’s called being happy Steve - you should try it - get you over this fucking tramp. For fuck sake. What’s got into you, you heard her friend, she’s here working in a bar getting those big tits she’s got fucked by losers all night. You think she’s moping around thinking about you? Jesus, you’ve had goldfish longer than you knew this woman.”       That should do it.            For the moment, Steve just stared at me. The guy’s mind reeling from this latest machine gun attack my soothing words had just delivered to the poor boys soul. But as helpful as I was, he really wasn’t understanding my point of view it seemed.       I really just could not get it. What was it that made the man so blinkered, so besotted with this girl? What special powers did she have over him that he could still be in love with her after all that had happened. I carried on, trying this time, as I had before, to be as tactfully as I could. I said,      “but, okay, maybe yeah, okay, she’s out there, and she’s thinking of you too - whilst other guys are fucking her, she’s still thinking of you.” 	 					****************      As the sun dropped away from the days blue sky, evening came. Its fading light bathing all it touched with its soft glow, until the presence of its beauty then as if a switch had been pulled from within the heavens, it departed us once more, leaving us only with earths warm ocean air drifting in off the water.       Steve and I sat on the patio of one of the many outside restaurants sitting on the small ring road which serviced this particular strip of paradise. The one way circuit moving traffic around the small seaside tourist town. Traffic that was now almost at a standstill.       The local vendors choking the road as they made the most of a captive audience locked in the endless bars and restaurants that lined its side. Their pickup trucks converted for advertising, loaded with speakers large enough to wake the dead or entice travellers into whichever bar, grill, day club, night club, they were doing their best to force feed the visiting folk with.       One holding the gold medal for annoyance seemed to be the largest of them all. The truck cruising around and around at three miles per hour. It’s flat-bed back home this evening to half a dozen Mai Thai fighters in full fight mode, all standing at the back feigning kicks. Shadow boxing imaginary title challengers as the speakers blared out the theme music to Rocky. A Thai announcer screaming in bad English how it would be crazy for us to miss the upcoming fight at the stadium where May had told us she would meet us the following evening.       Boom – Boom - Boom, Boom Boom, the music blared as the truck made its way slowly through the traffic towards the restaurant for the third time since we had sat down. The kids in the back, both western and Thai, topless in their loose shorts kicking away at nothing as the music blared.       Steve staring at the truck as once again the music stopped and the pre-recorded message recycled and restarted, spewing out its message for what now seemed to be the hundredth time. 	“Fuck these guys are cunts.” Steve said as he took a swig of his beer and shook his head slightly. I stared at him then at the truck now stationary and wondered how the patrons of the restaurant it was next to were enjoying their meal. 	“they’ll be done soon, they can’t keep this up all evening one of them surely has to have a fight or something?”      But they didn’t seem to have a fight or anything. The truck indeed keeping it up all evening as now on its sixth time around the block the truck had itself stopped in traffic right in front of us in the road. The music blasting. Boom - Boom, Boom, Boom… Boom…….Boom, Boom - Boom……..	“For fuck sake I said as I watched the kids on the back covered in sweat kicking away like fools. One though was a young man we’d yet to see. A new fresh face in amongst the rest of the idiots we’d seen passing the restaurant so far. A western man in his late twenties, up there looking and feeling tough. Topless, sporting his muscles and stars and stripes baggy shorts as he lashed out with venom with his feet, landing hard and powerful blows into the hand pads one of his buddies were wearing.	“That’s Lee Wilkes,” Steve suddenly said knowingly. He’s fighting for the Thai Federation Cup tomorrow night.” I stared at my brother for a moment, then laughed - how could he possibly know that?	“You follow this shit do you?” I asked curiously.	“It’s not shit it’s serious.” He said back. “same as you are when you go to the gym.”	“How you know his name?”	“Because he’s on that poster on the side of the truck.”And then I saw him, this guy having an early mid-life crisis in a poster that blended in with countless others plastered along the side of the truck. The man looking tough as he squared off against a Thai man of similar age. Looking back to him I could now see he had us both in his eyeline as he whacked his right foot hard once more into his colleagues hand pad. The man staring us down with attitude, feeling like a king as he lashed out with venom in time to the blaring music. Boom, Boom Boom, Boom, Boom – Boom. Holding the man’s stare, and waiting for him to finish, I said,	“Turn that music off you stupid cunt.”Not quite believing what he’d heard and smarting from the disrespect, Lee Wilkes holding on to the side of the truck leant forward and asked through the noise. 	“Say that again. Say that to my face.” So I did…. And then just as the man who’d know doubt just spent a year in training for the fight of his life’s temper burst, the truck began to move. And before I could say another word willingly or unwillingly the truck was gone. Disappearing along the road. Steve stared at it as the music drifted into the distance. Then once it had, he looked back at me and simply said. 	“Why’d you always start shit?”	“He’s the one with the problem not me - I’m not the one disturbing the peace.” I said back in my usual self-righteous manner. 	“Neither is he. The guys just promoting his fight. You’re lucky he didn’t kick your ass.”I was, and Steve for once was not wrong. But it wasn’t like I had any say in what came out of my mouth, so what could I do these days other than to just live with the consequences. Frowning, I looked to the little fella sitting on my lap as I heard Steve say.	“Well he’ll be back in about fifteen minutes so you can either apologize or get practicing all that Jiu Jitsu shit dad taught us because you’re going to need it.” But when the truck did arrive back in all its boisterous glory, Lee Wilkes was nowhere to be seen. 					******************	A few hours later sitting in a bar on the other side of town we heard the truck again. The same music blaring. The same announcement. The same kids on the back kicking away. But no title contender to be seen. We watched it pass, as the noise from the trucks speakers came and went for a moment drowning out the bars music. Watching it go, Steve said, as he looked at the girls in the bar hitting on men as they passed. 	“It’s tamer here.”	“You think so?”	“Yeah.”It was true, the place was tamer than Pattaya, but I had little doubt the end result was much the same. If his girl was here she’d probably be in one of these bars doing the same and I wondered how much my brother could take if we found her doing just that. With the guy being as sensitive as he was, and him being so loved up still despite the overwhelming evidence of what she’d done to him. There was a chance after what had happened with our father that it could take him over the edge. He needed to be eased back into reality that was certain. So I said,	“You need to be prepare yourself, there’s a high posibility your girl’s sucking some guys dick as we speak.”	 Taking a deep breath, Steve thought about that one. Then said. 	“Na, not Sherri. She didn’t do that shit. She told me.”	“What about to you?”Steve looked at me, then to another lonely soul as he sat himself down at the bar. 	“Oh me yeah – Heck yeah – but no she worked in a bar but didn’t go with guys. She was a cashier. She just took people’s money.”Well aint that the truth.We sat there, both of us, staring at the girls with a short skirts and high heels as they flirted with customers. The two of us listening to the music as it thumped. Steve no doubt, wondering if his girl was out there now giving butterfly kisses whilst being groped the same thing as these girls were. Me having no doubt.       It was a strange thing really, the two of us sitting there in this far off land. Both of us now fatherless. Both of us still deep down wondering why. The music just like in Pattaya drowning out the street. The two rows of bars lining either side of a road purposely constructed and developed for obvious monetary gain. A place for the locals to earn some good old fashioned cash. A amusement arcade placating the want and needs of a certain crowd you’d never invite for dinner. A long narrow strip of iniquity, dug into this tropical paradise. A dwelling which tugged at men’s primitive DNA. Capturing weakened fathers vacationing with their families. Horny men who couldn’t resist the urge to sneak away and ruin the rest of their holiday once the deed was done as they worried about herpes or monkey pox or worse and whether they’d passed it on to their wives.       But as much fun as it was watching the circus we still needed to find the love of my brothers life. Pimmy, Sherri’s special and loyal friend in Hua hin, who’d happily taken my money, wiggling her big toes with delight as she did, had told us this is where we would find her.       And now here we were.             From what I could see from where we sat, there had to be upwards to three hundred girls working along this road. If this Sherri was one of them, I would never know. I wondered as I sat there, stroking the little fella. The little puppy who seemed to draw more attention than any man I’d yet to see wandering this road we now sat in. The big question was that if Steve did actually somehow manage to spot this treasure of a woman, then would he even tell me he had. Should this be the case, I have to say I really didn’t care. Yes, I was out of pocket for seventy grand, which indeed is a lot of money. But I had to admit I was having fun. So it hadn’t all been that bad. Could be worse, I could be have been in some tar sands camp, or even in jail.      We had a couple more beers, and then I decided the time was right to bite the bullet and walk the good walk. How long could it take to stretch our legs and stroll the entire length of the road. Keep in the centre and have Steve stop outside every bar. Have him gawp at every girl in there and then move on. A few minutes later we had found her. Steve pausing for a moment, then with a deep breath and looking to the floor said,       “That’s her, the one sitting with grandad.” Stopping, I stared for a moment then looked to Steve, who holding onto his broken heart, I discovered hadn’t stopped. The man slowly disappearing into the crowd without looking back. Hearing the cat calls and the competing music blast my senses, I looked back into the bar at this little lady sitting in its corner. This lady with her big titties now loving another man three times Steve’s age. The old boy enjoying the twilight of his life. The pair of them nuzzled together on stools like a couple of teenagers lost in love.       So this was her, this was Sherri.             The love of my brother’s life. This woman I’d never met, but whom had now consumed so much of my attention on a daily basis.       With the little fella resting on the inside of my forearm I walked in and sat by myself down at a stool next to them. Sherry for the moment looking to me to see if I was a better option. Grandad not giving a care. The girl holding my stare as I looked back. The young, big bosomed woman smaller than I’d expected with her skinny legs and arms and short hair. Destroying the image I’d built. This vision in my brain of some Amazonian Thai lady capable of wrestling money from any unsuspecting fool.        Then with strategy and purpose and smothering the eye contact between this Sherri and I, in a swift and practiced cock blocking move, another girl arrived, extinguishing any potential relationship short or long term. The intruding girl standing next to me, offering the sweetest smile I think I’ve honestly yet to see. The girl looking into my eyes, then to the little fella on my lap and then to my big boots. Before she could say a word, another had arrived and another as I quickly found myself surrounded in a sea of young beauty. All the girls smelling nice. All of them are sexy as hell. All of them paying more attention to the little fella than myself, almost as though they’d never seen a dog before in their lives.      Shifting in my seat I looked back towards this Sherri and again caught her eye. This siren, this fugitive of a woman. Her hair looked good, freshly done, her bright red nails like a demons dagger claws, also freshly done. Same for her clothes, and the shoes that I had no doubt also bought. Dropping the older man like a sack of shit she moved through the group and stood before me. The girl looking into my eyes as  the others fussed and pawed at Little Fella sitting on my lap enjoying the attention.       The woman leaving her left hand holding onto my the upper part of my arm as she joined the others running her right hand across a little feller’s neck. Staring at me she said.      “Your dog nice, I like dog. What name.”       “Little Fella.” I answered.       “He not little forever.” Sherri answered with a dazzling white toothed smile that made me wonder if I’d also paid for her teeth.       “He get big like you.”Then she leaned in and still with her hand clasped onto the top of my arm she whispered.	“You handsome man.”I looked to her and then to the old gentleman she’d only seconds ago being pawing over. The man now in his nineties sitting there not alone but with another girl who seemed to be doing pretty much the same. The gentleman there smiling with his watery eyes as this new girl rolled her body against his. This man in the winter of his life, who had possibly already seen and done more than most ever would. This man making the most of his final days. Still loving the female form, looking to this young lithe nymph some seventy year his junior. His moist eyes smiling, either unknowing or perhaps uncaring about the girls change in shift.        There was one thing that I could not count out and that was that Steve, to get me of his back, had just picked the first random he’d seen with an ample breast and said, “that’s her”. But something inside told me different. Maybe it was these nice titties that she happily put on display. These titties I’d heard Steve in between complaining about his itchy back fixate about over and over for the last while as we’d headed south. Maybe though it was the new clothes, or the nicely cut hair, or the new expensive shoes she wore compared to everyone else in the bar. Then as the other girls became bored with my puppy and gave up on me, I bought myself a beer, and a lady drink for Sherri.       “Where you from?” she asked.       “Canada.” I replied quickly.       “How long here?”      “Not long enough.” I answered.      “You want girlfriend?” she asked me getting straight to the point.       “Maybe?”      “You very handsome.”      “Thanks.” Then remembering her friend in Hua Hin who had sold her out for money telling me she came from the south, I asked.      “Where are you from?”      “Bangkok.”      “You ever been to Pattaya?” And for a moment Sherri stared at the floor before smiling again and leaning in pushed her breasts against my side.       “No - no go Pattayyyaaa.”So two lies one after the other, but in reality what was I supposed to expect from a girl whom I’d just met working the room in a sleazy bar. 	“you married?” I asked.	“No - me not marrieeeed.” She was, we knew that, so, another lie.	“You have a boyfriend?”	“No, me no boyfrienddddd.”But she did and he went by the name of Lee Wilkes, but I was yet to find this out.	“You want lady?” my brothers girl then asked.	“maybe.” I answered.	“You want lady suck youuuu and you come on boom booms?”	“Really?” I answered back as I wondered if she’d used the same delightful opening line when she’d met my brother. But it was best I left Steve and the money out of the conversation for now. So I said,	“You charge Steve seventy grand for that?”And just as those words left my lips, Sherri understanding exactly what I had just said, looked up and saw Steve step nervously into the bar. And the moment he entered, she burst into tears, ran to him and hugged him deeply as she sobbed. 					***************      Steve stood there looking to me as his girl hung to his stomach like a limpet. Slowly moving towards me he shuffled the girl across the floor and then stood beside me. Annoyed he asked,	“What the fuck did you say this time?” 	“I didn’t say anything.”Then pulling back, Sherri looked up at Steve and with tears running down her cheeks, and said this time in near perfect English.	“He just told me he wanted to come on my breasts. I’m not that kind of girl.”Steve looked at me and if looks could punch me straight in the mouth, then I’d just taken one on the chin. It was obvious, to me anyway that again he was being played. The girl swiftly changing tack as soon as she’d seen him enter the bar. Could I say it was his fault? No not really, yeah she was working in the bar, but not all bar girls are pay for play. Especially ones as pretty and who spoke a level of English as this girl seemed now to be doing. I took a breath, I needed to look at it from my brothers perspective. Stay neutral in this situation, until he worked it all out for himself. I said,	“Don’t believe a word, you been a minute later she’d have had my dick in her mouth.” And with that there was no more dirty looks to give as Steve just hit me.       Now like I said earlier, I’ve been hit before and it rarely doesn’t hurt and this time was no exception. 					*************      I sat there on the other side of the bar. Just myself and the little fella watching on as Steve sat quietly with Sherri. This beautiful girl who’d just asked me to come on her tits now with tears in her eyes. Holding my brothers cheeks as she talked into his face without giving him a moment to speak. The girl spouting one bullshit line after the other in amazingly good English. Myself sitting there watching in disbelief alone with not one lady interested in changing that situation. Even if I did have a puppy. The old man living large with two girls. Kissing one and then the other in turn with his saggy skinned mouth.       Good for him. The man maybe having served his time. Working his entire life to raise and support a family who no longer cared, the man now with zero fucks to give.       Would that be me?             I wondered if I made it that far in life? Would I have the guts to no longer care and stand in a bar, listening to music I didn’t understand, with a pocket full of dick pills and breath mints. Probably not.       Catching the man’s eye I smiled to him as he switched from one girl to the next. The man’s damp eyes full of life showing a spirit that shone from deep within. Calling across, I said, 	“Bet you wish you knew about this place years ago.” And he simply said.	“I did.”					**************  	        With nothing other than blood on their minds the mosquito’s floated around me as I sat on the deck outside our hotel room. Steve inside, laid on the bed with the love of his life stretched out next to him. The distant rumble of thunder out to sea. The moon reflecting its presence as its light graced the water. The waves landing softly in a constant rhythmic flow on the sand. The sound of my brother with the love of his life in the room behind me. One minute talking, the next minute crying, the next fucking. The sound of this Sherri’s high pitched screams throughout it all. Then her squeaky voice kicking off again as soon as he’d get up to take a piss or clean his dick. Her constant sound over powering the whirr of the A/C, penetrating the glass sliding door and intruding into my world.	He needed to get it out in the open though. Get to the bottom of it all. Get this issue sorted, and most of all find my money. But seriously did I need to listen to it all? I didn’t. I just needed to stay calm, stay quiet and tune the girls voice out then see what he had to say in the morning. Leaning back I swung out my right arm and slapping my hand onto the window, shouting out. 	“Stick your dick in that thieving cunts mouth.”					**************	 By nine in the morning they’d both surfaced. The two of them all smiles and glee, like two teenagers who had just found tenderness for the first time. Sitting down at the breakfast table I had now occupied for the hour and a half, Steve said. 	“What’s with the pouty face?”	“You’d have one too if you slept on the beach.”	“Depends who you with.”It did I suppose. But I hadn’t had some fucking thief of a whore like him for company. I said as I watched this Sherri, as she wandered about loading up two plates from the buffet. One for her one for him, none for me. 	“So?” 	“Oh, it’s all sorted - all done - no worries.”	“Really?” I answered some what surprised as I watched Steve now begin to beam from within.	“Yeah, it’s sorted, problem over - we’re getting married.”For fuck sake. 	“I thought she was already married.” I said, in pure desperation.	“oh she is - but that doesn’t count.” Steve said straight back. Completely confused I then asked.	“It doesn’t?” 	“No, you know like I said - it’s a Buddhist thing.”I looked at Sherri. The girl no doubt bidding her time until her new on again ‘fiancé’ had had enough time to break the news. 	“So that’s it then – all sorted?” I asked.	“Yeah. That’s what I’m saying - She’s coming home with me. We gonna live in Calgary. She’s got a friend there.”	“Oh?”	“Yeah.”	“and what about my seventy grand?”	“That wasn’t her, she never stole that, it was her husband.”Of course she didn’t.	“The husband she doesn’t have? The one that doesn’t count because it’s a Buddhist thing?”	“Yeah - It was him - not her - He has it.”	“And does he know that this marriage he’s in is no longer valid?”	“Yeah…. No….. maybe? I’m. not sure.” Steve said as he scratched his head nervously and looked about the room.	“And where is he?” I asked as I felt what little I had left of my patience evaporating. 	“Well that’s the thing see.” Steve then said as he squashed his face up in embarrassment. “she said she needs some money to bribe someone so as she can let you know.”Surprise surprise.      So that was it. Apparently, I had to spend money to make money. That old chestnut. Well as much as Steve believed it all to be true, I didn’t. I did though need to tread carefully as I’d got this far and I didn’t need the woman running off again.       So I said as I looked at this girl who was now making a new claim for funds as she stood around with her breasts exposed in the same nice new high heels. The girl wasting time messing about with some bread. 	“Those tits she’s got fake?”	“No! I already told you that, remember?” Steve answered with a smile.	“What about the footwear?” I asked as I sat there looking again to the girls black leather with red soles.  	“Tell her the breakfasts on me. But if she needs to bribe anyone she can sell them new Jimmy Choo’s.”					***************	Leaving the restaurant I walked to the reception and booked another room for myself and the little fella for a couple of more nights. Asking them to keep me on the beach but as far away from Romeo and Juliet as possible.  And it was sitting there, this time on my own deck. Free of the groaning and crying and squeaky voiced endless monologues from my future sister in-law that Steve came to see me. This time alone.       What I’d do was go along with it, I thought. Not go along with it in the sense that I’d start giving the women cash for bribes. I’d already established that. But I’d just go along with the whole stupid marriage thing. I’d forget what she was, forget everything she had done before and let my stupid brother fall as far down that rabbit hole as he was prepared to go. Let him offer up this lure of marriage and permanent residency in Alberta with Steve or whoever she decided to shack up with once she arrived as bait for the info on the whereabouts of this husband who maybe was yet to know he was single. Then she could see just how rosy life was living inside an outdoor freezer for nine months of the year. Good luck with that. Lets see how much she gets to show off those nice titties to the boys down Whole Foods when they’re hidden away stuffed beneath a big thick goose down parka. I said.	“So you still marrying that lying cunt - when’s the wedding?	“Soon I think.” Steve said back ignoring the middle section of my question.	“Who’s paying for it?” I then asked, and that one threw him. Knowing that the man was now and had always seemed to have been perpetually broke for his entire working life. My brother by now having used up all his own savings since he’d arrived, and on top of the money he’d already lost was now eating further and further into mine.	“Well the family I suppose.”	“Our family?”	“Yeah.”	“So mum?”	“Well yeah, mum and dad, but dad’s not here so us then since we’re dad now yeah - us?”	“so in us you mean - Me?”	“If you’re offering then yeah great - thanks.”I wasn’t - but okay.It had always been that way with Steve, the kid seemingly taking a free ride through life. The younger brother who got everything from bicycles and clothes to cars to jobs and places to live, all handed down. Along with the odd bar in Pattaya. All this via what could be called younger brother default. This time, now it was a wedding. But if we were both lucky it would never get that far. I said, 	“Ok, marry the whore - the weddings on me, along with all the other shit that you need to get her back home with you. But know this, nothing happens until I get my money back.” And hearing this Steve just stood there, his mind whirring away as all the possible permutations came to mind, eventually he said.  	“I’m kind of stuck if you’re playing hard ball.”	“Pay for your own wedding then. Don’t involve me. Do it yourself and once it’s done you can work it out on your own just how to get that money back from this husband who does not exist. Maybe you can ask him if he wants to walk her up the aisle while you’re at it.”					*****************      I’d grabbed some breakfast for the little fella. Snagging a cup of milk and wrapping some bacon and some sausages in a napkin. I cut it all up with a tea spoon and put it out on the balcony for the puppy to eat. Leaving the Little Fella to pick at the food I then went for a swim and stepped out for once barefoot onto the sand. The sun was shining and I could see was the blue ocean calm before me as I walked out onto the beach. The soft sand like powder worked its way through my toes. Hitting the water, I looked along the shoreline. It was early, most people like Steve and his dreamboat girl were still eating fruit and drinking coffee. The water lapped at my ankles as I watched the little fella pick at his food occasionally testing the boundary marking instinctively for himself a safe zone.             Maybe I’d ruined him yesterday morning, dragging him into the ocean like I had when that vicious mutt had drowned itself. I waded out and dived in. Long gone was the feel of the ice cold glacial water I was used to. Back in the day when I’d swam the lakes that surrounded the Rockies. Lakes with towering majestic mountains peaked with snow. Sinking my legs down I turned and stared at the beach and watched the little fella now waiting at the water’s edge for me to return. The sea nicer than any bath I’d not wanted to have as a kid. Back in the day when I’d lay in that rare moment of childhood luxury, feeling the warm water on my skin. Putting up one fight about getting in, and then another when my mother told me it was time to get out.        Now though I was in a big one that felt almost the same. Laying back I looked at the sky as the water graced the back of my head and poured softly into my ears blocking out for the moment the world. A world that I didn’t really understand. A world most of us ever do. The morning sun on my face cooled by the small waves that moved constantly towards the shore. Fuck it was nice, Feeling soft sand beneath my feet when I’d let them drop down to the sea bed. Palms loaded with coconuts reaching up into the blue cloudless sky above. I took a deep breath once and then another and then another as I closed my eyes and tried to forget about it all. My brother, this Sherri girl, the money, and of course the one thing, that unrelenting vision in my mind that stayed forever present. The last moments of my father life. I laid there, floating in the water. Feeling the heat of the sun on my face and my chest. Trying in vain to push back those last images from my mind. But what was the point? Something as horrific as that, it was something you couldn’t just pour water onto and simply wash away. Even in water as nice as this. It was something I knew would never leave, and deep down there was a part of me that hoped it never would. Letting the weight of my legs sink down bringing me upright, I tried to touch the sand on the sea bed below to no avail. The ocean, as gentle as it was, was still in charge. The current taking me away from shore as though I was being held on a carriage made of angels. Kicking out with my feet, I headed for the shore. Swimming quickly through the calm blue water that felt as warm as some elusive dream.       Feeling the small waves break around my body I once again dropped my feet to the sand below. This time my toes digging into it’s softness. Then with the water now hitting the top of my thighs I began walking the rest of the way. Wading through the warm water with every step. Scanning the beach from side to side the shocking realization hitting me that it was now empty, and the little fella, my little puppy companion who’d been frightened to get his paws wet was nowhere in sight and was gone. 					*************It must have been just after one in the afternoon when Steve arrived on my balcony. Myself sitting there still without the Little Fella. My brother on cloud nine after no doubt getting laid all morning. Looking about, he asked. 	“Where’s pups?”Good question, Having searched every inch of the beach, and more. Looking for the tracks his tiny little paws would have made in the sand. Searching the trees. Scanning the water for his little body in case somehow he’d drowned. The inside of the many hotels in case, like myself, someone had scooped him up thinking he was lost. But, no, nothing.   	“Disappeared.” I said. “When I was swimming.”	“You drown him as well?” 	“Fuck off.” I replied bitterly. Then carried on with, “Where’s the wife?”	“Sherri’s great.”	“not what I asked?” I said as I then realised he was again hiding something. Then on a hunch and not wanting to worry him, I said.	“She’s fucked off again has she?”And she possibly had, the moment I said it I could see it in his face.	“She’s at the temple, someone died, and some hundred year old man’s in town. Said she needed to see the guy while he was here.”I thought back to the old guy I’d seen her pawing over the night before in the bar and wondered if it could be him. But that was just speculation and the kid didn’t need stuff like that festering though his mind. So I said. 	“She’s probably with that old guy we saw in the bar.”  Fuck, you idiot, I then saw the kid begin to inwardly squirm. The young man obviously worried again at the fact she may never come back. But what could I do now I’d said it, planted the seed so to speak. Then in my mind I made a decision. If you can’t say anything good. Then just don’t say anything at all. So that was it, that was the solution – done deal - it was what I’d do from now on. Silence would be as they say golden. Then I said,	“She’s gone off to find someone else to come on her tits.” But this time there was no reaction. No anger or retaliatory words to my ungovernable crudeness. Instead, with a shrug he simply said,	“you’re just jealous that’s all.” 	“Is that right?” I answered in surprise.	“Yeah,”	“Ok. So tell me if you’re now her fiancé, then why you not going with her to this ‘temple’?”	“She offered but said they go on forever and I’d be bored. Said it would be too hot and I should stay with you so you don’t feel left out. She’s thinking of everyone in the family now we’re back together and part of it cos we’re in a serious relationship.”	“She said all that, she don’t even speak English properly?” But she did, I knew that much. Hearing the girl go on and on all night with her dialogue. The girl having a better grasp of the English vernacular than she was letting on with her simple ‘me not marrieeeed...’ and ‘me no boyfrienddddd…’ bar girl charade she’d been putting on for me. 	“Yeah well we communicate in a different way because we have this special bond. You wait till tomorrow when she’s back. You’ll see what I mean.”      But I didn’t have to wait that long before I saw her next because she wasn’t at the temple, she was at the arena, waiting to cheer on her other boyfriend Lee Wilkes as he prepared himself to become the Mai Thai Champion of south east Thailand. 					******************With one last look for the Little Fella I’d bought myself a clean shirt, put my boots back on and headed to the arena. The place full to the brim with both Thai’s and locals. The big night of the season. Heavily advertised and already in full swing as we’d arrived to watch other younger boxers as they’d waye’d. Pressing the inner palms of their boxing gloves together in a prayer like gesture as they bowed their heads and held the tips of their gloves to the sky. Then kicked the shit out of each other until one was either knocked out or the blood was ruining the canvas floor.       The place packed with a good mix of tourists and locals. I looked about at the ex-pats who no doubt lived here with their young Thai wives. Then to the moms and dads away with the kids all looking relaxed. The kids fidgety in their hard plastic seats that made their asses itch. Proud of their sun burn and peeling noses. The old guy I’d seen last night in the bar there also watching the action. The gentleman sporting a different girl on either arm. The man sitting close to me half way up the arena. Watching the action through his watery eyes, happy and fascinated by the fights.	“You think we could take them with all the shit dad taught us?”	“Not here no. In a cage or in the street maybe. We’d need to get them on the floor. Those kicks are pretty strong. You wouldn’t want too many of them hitting you in the knee.” I answered in total honesty. And they were strong, the kids whipping those kicks in despite their age and landing them with tremendous force at will. Everyone watching, oohing and aahing when things got messy. Everyone there waiting for the big event. The main ticket. Lee Wilkes, the wonder tough kid all the way from Brookesville Florida. The tough American with his MAGA hat in his locker, who was here to show these locals how it was done. 	As the pre events came to a close and they cleaned the blood from the floor, the atmosphere changed. The lights dimming the music fading down. Then as if that truck that made the rounds touring the restaurant circuit night after night had itself entered the building and attached itself to the PA system the Rocky music started up again. Boom – Boom Boom Boom……. Booom….. Boom…..Boomdly Boomdly  Boom…… Booo-ooommm!The spot lights came on, as two beautiful girls appeared from the within a tunnel at the side of the arena. The pair of them, majestic, with their long dark hair and longer legs. Both wearing knee high boots, tight shorts and tighter tops, making their way to the ring. Reaching it they climbed up and dipping under the ropes separated, as they strutted to either side of the ring.       Raising their arms in the air they began to make slow laps around the ring, waving to the audience as the whistles and cheers reigned down from the stalls. Watching them with his mouth open Steve said, to me as I sat there in shock.	“Holy shit, what the fuck?” Then looking to him as he looked to me in disbelief, I asked.	“Give up your girl for one of them would you?” Shaking his head Steve looked back to the girls, saying.      “In a heart-beat.”       “Well that’s nice but the one on the right is my girl May, so she’s taken and the other one’s a guy so have fun with that.” Steve looked at me, 	“Fuck off - she’s your girl? No fucking way?” But she was, well kind off I suppose. Steve looked back to the ring as the girls made their way to the center. Then with a wave of her hand to me, she held my gaze and as though I was the only man in a five thousand seat arena, she blew me a kiss.	Steve stared at her for a moment, then swung his head quickly to look me in the eye. 	“Was that to you?” He asked as he looked behind hoping to see some sort of Greek Adonis worthy of such a beautiful girls attention. Not seeing one, he looked back as the music intensified once more. The announcer stepped into the ring once more and holding the microphone to his lips said in perfect English.	“Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the main event. Fighting tonight for the South East Thailand Mai Thai championship belt Mr Leeee Wilkessss! And with that Lee Wilkes entered the arena followed by his entourage. The guy now wearing a silver cloak that sent shooting stars from the spot lights beaming back into the crowd. The young man from Florida living the dream.	“That the same prick who was on the back of that truck?” Steve asked as he stared down at the man walking through the crowd towards the ring. 	“Yep.” I answered as I looked at Sherri right behind him as she followed with the small entourage he’d amassed. If Steve hadn’t seen her, then all the better. No need to ruin the night. Then I said.	“That your girl there with him?” Forgetting about May and her sister, Steve stared hard with half his ass coming off his seat. The girl in a cap, looking good in full make up and glitzy clothes as though she’d just stepped off of Rodeo drive. 	“No, can’t be….” Steve answered as he still watched from afar. “Can’t be. Looks like her though., I give you that. But no. Sheri’s at that funeral at the temple.” But with those words I know that deep down he knew it was her - and the only funeral she’d attended was his. 					***************With Steve not really wanting to talk we sat in a restaurant and waited for May and her sister to arrive. Steve looking as though he’d just lost his dog. Myself having done just that, but still smiling. 	Then they arrived, May opening the door first and entering with her sister in tow. The two girls in their civvy clothes now but still looking good. Reaching the table we both stood. As May looked to my shorts and my big boots then kissed me on the lips. Saying with a smile.	“Hello handsome.” With her hand out she shook Steve’s hand and introduced herself with perfect manners before introducing her sister to us both.	“Le, this is my boyfriend Sandy.”I liked that, this beautiful girl standing there in her sexy flip flops claiming me to her sister as her man. Steve though I felt had forgotten about his tramp of a girl and was still in shock with regard May’s and her sisters beauty. The man with his mouth half open, for once speechless. Carrying on May looked to him and smiled. 	“And I take it that this is Steve?” She said with not a hint at all of her knowing the struggle I had been through trying to find him along with the reason why. 	“Yes,” Steve said. 	“Le, pleased to meet you.” Le said politely as I pulled out two chairs for the girls to sit down. The two of them playing with their hair as they did. 	“And what about the fight, did you enjoy that?” May asked. And I had enjoyed it. The ferocity of the punches and the power in the kicks way beyond what I’d witnessed in the previous bouts. It had been good, a close match, ending with a knock out in the final round. A full on crowd pleaser that was for sure. Along with seeing May and Le up there with the numbers held high in between rounds. Both looking cool as they walked in circles. The fact that the local guy I wanted to win hadn’t, and that I’d had to watch my brother squirm as that arrogant prick pranced about the blood splattered ring and kissed his girl in celebration at the end like some sort of king. 	“I wish the Thai guy had won.” Is all I said.	“Oh don’t worry he did.” Le replied. Confused I looked to May then to Le as she surprisingly said in perfect English.	“The man lost - but he’ll go home bruised with his pockets full, and the other guy will go home with just a cheap chromed belt believing he’s a hero.” I sat there looking to them both and then to Steve. 	“What about prize money?” I asked, “there has to be prize money?”But there wasn’t any.					******************      We sat on the beach in the moonlight and watched the waves gently end their journey, falling and sinking into the sand. Me in my big boots, May barefoot. Her head against my shoulder as though I had been hers and hers alone for all of her life. Then I thought about the Little Fella,  And just as I was about to admit to her that I had lost him, May said.	“What happened to the dog?”Taking her head off my shoulder, May looked to me with concern. 	“I lost him. I think he run away.”	“How?” 	“I was swimming right here and when I got out he was gone.”Placing her head back against me May stayed silent for a while. Then said. 	“It happens, but you’ve got some good karma coming your way so maybe he’ll show up.”Good karma? Now that was a stretch, Especially with the shenanigans I’d pulled lately. Mine was all used up, I was sure of that. That though was a side of me I certainly did not want this beautiful girl to know about. I’ll be keeping that to myself for sureSo taking a deep breath. I said.	“Tell that to the guy who went out the window.” Fuck! For once, just once would be possible just for once to keep my big mouth closed. Confused May waited a moment thinking. Then finally she asked,	“Are you talking about what happens with the ladyboys in Pattaya?”	“Yeah,” I said for once not lying. May frowning, thinking, then saying, in a quiet and manner of fact way.	“Yes, well they do that. It’s a thing. Happened the other night as well I heard. Some gay guy in Boystown went through a window. Then another on walking street. That guy died though. Two in a row on the same evening. Would you believe it?”	“Really?”	“Yes, sad hey. Poor man…. Anyway, no I was talking about you and the little puppy you just rescued, and don’t forget all those lottery tickets you bought and handed out as gifts. And the dress you bought me.” Dress - what dress?       “Good karma, it’s coming your way. I think.” May carried on saying. The lottery tickets, yes, I did remember. I remember watching the poor guy. The guy in his wheel chair, forcing his way through the crowd. The man looking hot and worn out as he stopped at me. The man opening his case full of lottery tickets and offering them up for me to buy. Then me being me, buying the lot so as he could go home. Then after as I stood there like a fool with this beautiful women in the corner of my eye waiting on the off chance Steve would pass by, I’d given them all away to any local who looked like they needed a bit of luck. 	“You saw that?”	“Oh yes, I saw that. Why do you think I’m here now?”Okay, well, that kind off puts a little piece of the ‘why me’ puzzle into place. 	“Yeah, you know, felt sorry for the guy.” 	“Well, be proud, as that woman you gave some tickets to. The one with the kid. She hit the jackpot.” The one with the kid. I sat up and looked to May. If I could remember some of that night I certainly did remember her. Seeing her there passing with her kid and thinking the boy should have been in bed.  	“Really?” I said in surprise.	“Yeah, she hit the jackpot. She’s been asking about you. Wants to say thanks.”Smiling, I looked at May. Now that was the best news I’d heard in a while. That and having one of the two most beautiful girls in the arena blow me a kiss, then claim me as her boyfriend that is. Made up for having to endure Steve’s short lived engagement to some cock sucking bar girl I suppose.	“How much she get?” I asked.	“They say, it was thirty five thousand baht. So a hell of a lot.”	“Wow.”	“people say, there’s bad people trying to get it off her now though. Cops as well wanting there cut.”	“Cops?”	“Yeah, they’re not all good - It happens.”Then we sat there, May looking out to sea. Myself wondering about the little fella along with Steve who’d wandered up the beach arm in arm with Le. The young lady looking more feminine than most girls with her long legs and slim waist and features. May being completely open about the girls gender. The big question for me though, since both Steve and I had been in her company was whether the girl had gone all the way with this transition from boy to girl she had obviously taken to perfection. That though was something that was really none of my business. So I left it. Then asked. 	“Your sister got a dick?”	“Oh yes.” May answered without hesitation. “You know that though right, I told you.”Did she? I wondered. There was a few things I’d been told but couldn’t remember because of my drinking. The dress being another of them. 	“I just thought, maybe it’d fallen off that’s all.”	“Oh.” May answered. “No it’s still there. That things not going anywhere. She likes it.”Fuck me, this is going to be good. Steve doing his best work to get over that bar girl and I fix him up with a guy. Well worse things have happened. 	“You worried about Steve?” May asked.	“Why, should I be?”	“No,” May said, “but they looked quite cozy when they left. So maybe, well you know.”Well you know?	“you’re his brother. If he does not know then you think he’s going to get angry?”That one I was not sure about. Normally no, he’d either laugh it off or drop and start experimenting. But today of all days - who knows. Suddenly finding a three course meal tucked away in a girls panties could send him over the edge. Then before I could speak May said. 	“Don’t worry, Le’s no softy, she’s done Mai Thai since she was four. She’d have given that American guy a problem tonight if it had been her in that ring.” 				******************      By the time morning had come. Steve was back in his room and we found Le sitting on the deck. But it was Le who had the shiner and not Steve. What had happened it turned out, is that things had all been going well, until Steve decided to go out on the town.       Leaving May to talk to her sister and so as not to make a scene, I pulled my brother to one side.       “You went looking for that fucking slut didn’t you?” I asked. Which Steve vehemently denied - but I knew him better. To me, in my mind it was pretty straight forward and obvious. I could just see the two of them walking arm in arm along the circuit until my brother had come across the celebration party taking place in some restaurant he’d been hoping to find. The place full of western wanna be kick boxers loaded to the tits with testosterone. All of them whooping it up a storm. Celebrating with the new champs and his friends - all fresh out from Florida in their wife beater shirts. The guys buddies with their mullet hairdos and goatee beards bigging up the victory of their newly crowned king.       And I hadn’t been wrong.       All of the guys in training drunk on little more than three beers after downing water for months in the hope of achieving peak physical fitness as per their local Thai trainers instruction. The friends out from Brookesville, not in training, well on their way with the booze before the fight had even started. The normally a quiet place to eat they’d descended upon now turned into just the opposite.       The wanna be Mai Thai fighters, themselves young boys, all in their late teens or early twenties. Sent away by their parents in the hope they learn some discipline. The young men, rowdy in victory. There with their new Thai girlfriends they’d met whilst blowing their parents hard earned allowance money whoring in the local bars. The boys doing what they could to show everyone what pricks they really were back home and emulate the new champion in town. 	So like the fool my brother was and with an incredibly beautiful young lady on his arm, he’d headed inside. Cutting through all the cheering and chaos of drunken youth, absent of authority, as they laughed and jeered. He’d sat himself down and ordered a beer. One for himself, and one for Le. The two of them both sober in amongst a sea of ovations and debauchery.       Sweaty boys doing their best to be men with their red virgin cheeks and wet hair. Throwing beer and insults in play as they wrestled and jousted in the hope that their new king Lee Wilkes would show the twinkling of attention they craved. Then Lee Wilkes had arrived through a door in the back of the room. The king of the hour, the South East Thailand Mai Thai champion. This hero from Florida who’d arrived, trained hard and defeated Thailand’s best. This man who they all wished they could be.       The man moving with purpose, his new title belt nonchalantly slung over his shoulder as though he’d just slayed a dragon. The man carrying the swagger and attitude of a champion. Then Steve had seen her, this girl he loved, as she’d arrived from the washrooms adjusting her dress. The girl he adored then standing there draping her arms around this new champion’s neck. Kissing the man’s cheek over and over until she’d seen Steve and stopped. 	“And?” I asked, as I shook my head wondering if the man was ever going to get a brain.	“And what?” He asked back as he looked at me.	“And?”	“Well your girls sister, must have been bored as she asked if we could go.”	“And, you didn’t, and you started a fight?”	“No – not me it was her. She knocked that guy who just won that belt out.”That one I had not expected. 	      “Sorry? She knocked him out?”	“Yeah, he got mouthy with her and she kung fu’ed him in the chin.” And that’s exactly what had happened. Le seeing the girl Lee Wilkes was with staring at her man and quickly understanding the situation. Not wanting to find herself in the centre of a love triangle. The girl had stood and had begun to leave, only for Lee Wilkes to spot her and knowing May’s beautiful sister from the few big venues he’d fought at and attended during his rise to the top, and being the bigoted prick that he was, had raised his arms in a command for silence before saying loudly for all to hear.      “Trannies and their fag boyfriends can fuck off and drink next door.”And before Steve could understand that the idiot was referring to his new girl and him. Le had moved towards him fast, swung around and caught the newly crowned champion in the neck with her right foot and knocked him to the floor. Only sadly to be sucker punched in the face by a younger wanna be Mai Thai champion who was also soon to have his dream cut short.        The kid being one of the boys we’d seen fight and lose earlier in the night. The young man having had a thing for May and Le and getting nowhere all evening as they’d waited back stage. The young man with an attitude, who wasn’t yet even good enough to win a match that his opponent had been paid to lose.	“Okay?” Said May, as we arrived back on the deck at the same time she’d finished talking to her sister. The beautiful woman holding her composure as she walked into Steve’s hotel room without asking and bringing back out a cold beer wrapped in a small towel. The two of them talking in Thai as she held the towel to Le’s eye. Then May turned to Steve in outrage. 	“That man - he said fuck off to you and my sister?” 	“Yeah.” Steve answered as May turned to me to say.	“That is so bad – so bad.”					*****************      I was told by May that what we needed to do was to go to the temple. Obviously bad spirits had attached themselves to Le and Steve, she had said, and this is what had attracted the bad energy that had caused the fight. Now if this was truly the case then I’m sure there must have been a coach load of bad spirits all taking a vacation on me. She did though also have another reason for taking a trip to the temple, but I was yet to find this out. 	“It’s where most strays end up when they can’t find a road to live on.” May had said, as we arrived and pulled through a pack of dogs sprawled out on their sides. The dirty mutts full of ticks. All sleeping the day away in the shadow of the temple emblazed in gold.	      “People bring them here when they’ve had enough of their pets or if they’ve found one, say…. wandering the beach.” And with those words, like a miracle, I saw the little fella in amongst a pack of dogs as we got out of the car and approached the temples side. The little fella now with his collar gone. The puppy dog rushing to my feet as he saw me, spinning around and around my big boots until he’d felt my giant hands lift him into the air. May there with me. Gently stroking him with her long fingers and painted nails. The woman looking as though she was about to do a photo shoot in the long clinging gown I’d purchased and did not know. The girl taking selfies with the pair of us and the puppy in amongst the temples towering golden peaked arches and Buddha statues. Smiling she said.	“You see Buddha’s already looking out for you.”And I suppose he was, I couldn’t argue that, as I’d have never thought or known to look here. I said, 	“You think someone was worried and picked him up off the beach?	      “That’s what you did?” May replied with a smile.      Well, it was a little more complicated than that. We walked hand in hand. Myself in my cut of jeans and big boots with a super model at my side. We passed a limousine bus parked at the bottom of the steps. It’s side door open showing comfortable leather airplane seats inside.       Then we walked up the tall steps that led to the temple, and following May’s que, I took off my boots. Pulling out the laces, I made a quick collar and lead and tied the little fella to my boots and barefoot stepped inside. Now I’m not a religious man at all, and if I had ever been in a place of reverence I’d never felt at home. Here though in this place of worship with its golden statues I honestly felt no different.       I looked around, seeing the monks up on a platform all sitting inline. The men of mixed age all crossed legged. Robed in their orange gowns. Their heads shaved and at peace. None looking to the beautiful girl who had just entered the room. The tourists pretending not to be distracted from the imagined awe this sanctuary evoked from within them.       Centre stage sat an old monk, the man looking briefly to us both as we entered. The man whose face I’d seen in photos as he sat in prayer on the back of larger vehicles and mini buses over on the mainland. The man sitting at peace, but looking tired.       Leaning in May whispering into my ear.       “That’s Ajahn Phra TaSol. He’s a big deal down here.”Staring at the man for a moment longer than I should, I looked into his face. His tired sunken eyes lined and watery reminding me of the other older gentleman I’d recently been in the company off. 	“He’s never been at peace, although he should. He’s saved enough souls. He’s never been at peace? The guy’s a monk for fuck sake.“Everyone thought he was gone a month ago,” May carried on saying. “but it looks like he’s back.” And they had thought he was gone. Especially Ajahn Phra TaSol, this monk who’d entered the temple as a young orphaned child and never left. This monk spending his entire long life dedicated to helping all he could. This monk exhausted by age. Thee man laying down on the woven straw mat that he knew so well. Knowing his time had finally come. And as he’d laid there, taking his final inhalations of air, he’d waited for death to take him. Feeling the shallow breaths and his heart slow as his well lived life began to wind down as the day past and became night. Ajahn Phra TaSol just lying there. Listening to the chants of his fellow monks gathered by his side. All chanting as one. Their heads bowed down with rhythm and purpose. Sending ancient spells, cast and spoken softly, in ancient words to the spirits who waited to guide this great man’s spirit onwards. Onwards towards the bright white light of mortality that awaits us all. And then as Ajahn Phra TaSol lay there awaiting the death he longed so much for, he had realized, he was again wasting his time. And getting up again for what felt like the hundredth time, he went off and got some noodles. 	“How old is he?” I asked quietly.	“one hundred and seven.”	“Fuck me.” I said quietly, as I looked about to all the tourists now without their sandals but still in their socks. Some wandering in their shorts with their burnt red legs. Others in their long baggy elephant pants with sweaty faces. All reveling in their new found Buddhist belief. Sitting in their best yoga pose before the almighty Buddha and his oldest trusted ambassador. Each with their heads bowed in silence as the monks to the side of him chanted in groups. 	Still feeling the eyes of the horny men following May as she held my hand, I walked further in. Smelling the incense I looked up to the ornate painting on the ceiling and the golden Buddha that stood before me. More monks lined the walls, sitting cross legged in silent prayer as they soothed the souls of the needy and fed the egos of these self-absorbed proselytes.	We sat down, in front of a young monk, joining the others. Each of us now with our own personal envoy who had Buddha’s ear. The kid in his robe with his bare feet and his smart phone at his side, looking as though he’d not long left school. The boy sitting at peace.       May finding her space before him as I crossed my legs and felt the bones in my ass dig into the ceramic tiled floor. The monk getting straight to it as he eased immediately into prayer. May with her eyes closed, me pretending to close mine as the meaningless words spewed from the young orange robed shaven headed boy before me who should have been out with his friends. The little fella outside yapping. Myself hearing it over this monks unfathomable words. May, serene in the moment. The tourists in their pulled up socks and odd coloured shorts seemingly not. Their heads twisting in irritation towards the door. The Thai’s there seemingly hearing nothing at all.       And then, as the monks chants eased, eventually concluding. I closed my eyes as May opened hers as I felt the touch of her hand on my arm to let me know it was time to wake.       Buddha’s own young emissary staring down at me in complete calm. The young man reaching out his hand as he smiled. The young man taking my right hand in his. Untying a golden sash from his wrist and tying it firmly to mine. Then dipping some hollow reeds into an urn full of water, he pulled them out, and splashed the water they had collected hard into my face. Once, then twice, then three times. And with that he was done.  Any message Buddha had wanted to send to me, had been sent, and I sat there with the spray dripping from my face and a wet shirt. 	I looked to May who with a nod of her head signalled me to leave. The little fella’s yapping outside now outwardly louder than it had been as I’d sat receiving my message from a god I did not know. And then I saw him, this monk who’s only wish now was to die. The man raising his head and looking to me again with his tired eyes. Raising his hand he summoned me over.       Slowly I walked to him. Passing the tourists in their baggy yoga pants and plastic smiles. The man holding his hand to me until I’d arrived. The old monk looking to me through his sharp eyes housed with his worn out sockets. His skin battled and weary. The man slowly taking from his neck the his own personal amulet of Buddha encased in gold and nodding as he placed it in my hand. The monk staying silent. Nodding to me as though we had met before and were old old friends.       The tourists as I respectfully backed away, showing their jealous distain with their snippy looks and comments in a language I could not comprehend, but understood nonetheless. Myself accepting and completely sympathetic to their frustrations. These people, these temple junkies, who’d travelled halfway around the world to visit as many temples as they could find along with the hope of meeting the great one hundred and seven year old Ajahn Phra TaSol before he moved on.       These spiritual travellers seeing their time with their transcendent leader interrupted by a little puppy and a monster in cut down shorts. It was their time, and time was precious to all. There was no doubt that I owed each and every one of them an apology. So with my new gold encased amulet in hand I slowed as I headed to the door. Turned and said to them all.	“Get a life you fucking plastic losers.”Then we stepped outside. The little fella just as excited to see me as he was when I’d popped myself out of the car. May asked.	“What did Ajahn Phra TaSol say?”	“Nothing.” I replied. Then carried on as I showed May the amulet with its little Buddha encased in gold.	“Oh my,” May said as she took the amulet in her hand and looked at it’s fine carving and tiny stone Buddha. Then she looked up at me. 	“Oh, to get one of these, you are so special. So so special. What did you say to those people.”Well I’d gotten away with that one - she hadn’t heard or perhaps understood the accusatory plastic slight I’d just delivered. Just tell her you liked their socks. So bullshitting I answered. 	“Oh, I just told them they’re all cunt’s.” Fuck.I looked to the door half expecting one of the men to come bursting out in anger.	“Really?”	“Yeah, I might get some socks like they have - they’ll look good with these boots and that necklace grandad just gave me.” 					*************      We sat in the car, myself driving through the narrow roads that weaved across the island. My new amulet around my neck. The little fella back safely snuggled into my lap. Motorbikes passing. All travelling as though the riders homes were on fire. Cars sitting up my ass doing just the same. The motorcycle riders pushing the small Honda’s engines to the limit as they scraped past on the inside or the outside of my big fat SUV. Looking to the sash now tied to my right wrist and the new gold Amulet around my neck, May Said,	“So really, tell me the truth, how was your first meeting with your new god?” To be honest, I hadn’t given it much thought. I’d just gone through the motions and then had water thrown in my face by a kid who’d just got off playing games on his phone. Then some old guy who looked as though he wasn’t going to make the weekend had given me a necklace. But there was no doubting that to May it had been a hallowed experience. So trying to look at it all from her perspective, I said,	“Kids lucky I didn’t knock the prick out, throwing water at us like that.”Fuck! As I heard the word leave my lips I tried to keep my eye to the road. Then tried to change the subject. Tell her it was a revering religious experience. So I said.      “Kid should have been at school.”	“Maybe he is at school.” May replied without a moment of hesitation. Then looking to the amulet around my neck, said.	“That’s to bring you good luck. I doubt Ajahn Phra TaSol gives them out that easy.”	“Is that so?” I replied as I wondered if the thing was real gold and how long I’d now have to keep wearing the thing without upsetting my new girls religious sensibility’s. May asked, as I watched another motorcycle pass me at speed before breaking hard in front of the SUV so as it could make a left turn.        “So you want to go back sometime?”I didn’t, that was a given. Unless the little fella got himself kidnapped again by another good Samaritan. But religion can be a sensitive issue at the best of times. I knew that. Especially in a fledgling relationship. Tell her - Yes, absolutely. You’d love to go back. So I said, “No.” And hearing that one singular word dump from my lips the way it had with complete and absolute honesty May for the moment just stared. Her eyes burning into the side of my head. Then with a smile she said. 	“Honesty is good. No one needs a liar in their life.”No, nobody needs a liar in their life – especially my mother.					*************      We moved on, hitting the coast road that ran back towards Chaweng beach. The other temple of a different nature with it’s pure white sand, gentle surf and palm trees awaiting us.       May though, it seemed, not being one to let things go. Had arranged a meet up with the authorities before we’d get there. The police assuring her that they’d be waiting at the Mai Thai training Gym which housed the fighters she’d had the pleasure of meeting at the arena the previous evening. 	“Cops?” I asked, when she’d told me what she had done.	“No one assaults my sister.” She said with surprising ease.	“I think she hit first though.” And according to Steve she had, but maybe there was a chance that my lovely lady did not get that side of the story. I asked.	“How’s it work here then if there’s a fight.” To which placing her hand upon my leg May said. “If you are disrespectful then you have to accept consequences. Had this have been on the street the Thai’s would have left them all unconscious on the road…. Regardless of who started it.” Okay….I remembered being left unconscious in the street myself after getting heavy handed and being thrown through that window by some ladyboy. 	“I get it.” I said “I get it.”	“I’m not like Le,” May then said. ‘I’m not the type to fight. So instead I’ll use the system.”But Le was the type to fight as we know, and the fight was not over. As when we arrived to see the cops waiting outside. Le and Steve were already inside, and Le was lacing up her gloves. 					Chapter Seven        Le stood in the ring, the ginger headed lad who’d sucker punched her with his foot the night before standing there beside the heavy bag on the gym’s floor below, not knowing what to do. Le up there barefoot, sporting a shiner with her hair in a pony tail. Her dick hanging freely in her lose fitting shorts. The gyms trainer having heard about what had happened the night before not saying a word. Letting it all play out to it’s natural conclusion. 	We walked into the open gym from the outside road. The cops following behind with their holstered guns and their tight fitting brown uniforms and shiny boots. May looking to her sister and then to Steve as the cops found a seat. We stopped at Steve’s side. Looking to the dog in surprise he said,	“Fuck me, where’d you find him?”	“Temple.”	“Yeah?”	“Yeah.”Then he saw the golden sash on my wrist and the amulet.	“What the fucks that?”	“Monk put it there - then threw water on me.” Laughing Steve asked.	“You punch him out?”And my brother hadn’t been wrong thinking this. As there had been a time when we were younger when I had punched out a member of another ministry. But he’d been Catholic, so we won’t go there. I said.	“No - You can never hit a monk….Never - ever.”Then I looked at Le standing in the ring ready to fight as the ginger kid moved from one foot to the other as he thumped at a bag that he knew would not hit back. Turning back to Steve I asked. 	“Why’s she up there and not you?”	“Wouldn’t have it. ‘My fight’ was what she said.”I then looked back to Le standing there with her bruised eye. The kid trying to look tough as he laid his fists into a heavy bag. Sweeping it with low blows after using his feet. The kid deep down wanting to run. And just as I was about to say something, May did it for me. The sexy woman with her long straight hair and longer legs calling across to the boy with the ginger hair who’d kicked her sister in the face.	“I’ll give you a choice you coward - Get up there and fight.” Then with a nod to the two police officers sitting on the bench. She continued saying,  “Or go with them – your choice.”      The kid looking straight to the cops sitting there with their chests decorated in ribbons of merit. Both waiting. Both with little clue as to what was going on and caring less. Then making the right decision, as a wave of courage swept through his frightened body. The ginger haired boy took a deep breath and headed up to the ring and dipped himself under the ropes. 	Seeing things were about to kick off and knowing exactly why, a trainer climbed up, and positioned himself in between the two of them. Then with a slice of his hand whipping down between them both, the fight was on. Le dancing around the ring for a bit, watching the ginger haired young man follow her with his fists raised. Then moving in fast, spinning around, using the same kick she’d used on the champ of the hour the night before. Le caught the boy in the face. Knocking him to the floor along with his pride. Then she waited, giving him time to recover until the boy stood. Shaking his head and feeling the blood run from his nose he began to bounce with his arms raised he shook off the hit to his face and moved forward. The boy doing well and looking good. Jabbing and hooking the way he’d been taught. He jabbed then hooked. Jabbed then hooked. Then let go with a sweeping kick with his right leg. Once, then twice. Every blow almost hitting but none really connecting as Le out maneuvered everything the lad who wished he was back home in England had to offer. The boy who had come half way around the world to become a champion, quickly realizing he was easily being outmatched by a ladyboy – and a pretty one at that.       Then just as he thought things could not get any worse, he jabbed, jabbed again, threw a cross, swung a leg up and out at Le’s head and as soon as he had he felt the heel of her foot hit his chest, as she spartan kicked the boy to the floor. And as he laid there trying to recover the wind back into lungs Lee Wilkes came through the door along with Steve’s fiancé Sherri.				***************      The first people he saw were the police. Then the girl who’d kicked him in the neck the previous night, up in the ring standing over the ginger haired kid on the floor. Seeing him and instantly forgetting about the current fight she was in, Le quickly turned her attention to the champ. Standing there now giving the man the invite to step up and join her in the ring. Then Lee Wilkes saw myself and Steve standing with May and at that point everything must have fallen into place. Without missing a beat, trying to sound cool, and taking a chance the two police men didn’t understand English, he said as he looked over to the two police officers.	“What the fucks five O doing in my gym?” His gym. The man full of arrogance and attitude of a man who’d forgotten he’d been knocked out by a girl the previous evening. The man laying claim and full ownership to the one place that had treated him like a human being, training him up from the loser he was to become a champion. Then I watched the man turn back towards me. The guy knowing my face but unable to give it a time and place. The guy believing in his own narcissistic mind that he still carried street cred. He looked to my brother and said,	“Tell your tranny girl I don’t hit women even if they got a dick.” The man’s whole demeanor being nothing short of screaming out I’m a dumb bigoted fuck. The man standing there with a stocky body of a fighter. His hair shaved an inch above his ears. The man oozing attitude.       Now believe it or not, for pretty much all my adult life I’ve lived by one rule which I’d adopted after reading a quote from Mark Twain years ago. In which he simply said, “Don’t argue with stupid people as they will bring you down to their level.” Or something like that. And this was without a doubt the correct time and place for this rule to be applied. Along with the other reason, being that I was there with May and even though her intentions were malevolent in nature, I was still her guest. So with me being me, I said back. 	“I’m sure her dicks bigger than yours.”Then not quite able to believe what he’d just heard Lee Wilkes stared at me. The man’s infantile brain searching for a clever comeback which could never be found. So waiting, I stood there holding a puppy, then he looked to my legs and my cut off shorts and big boots. The man asking,	“Who the fuck are you?” And then as the stars aligned in his Floridian, red necked, gator infested mind, he remembered. Lifting his arm and pointing his finger to me, he then twisted it at me as though it was a gun.	“Yeah, I remember you, the mouth from the restaurant?” Lee Wilkes said as he looked again to the two cops sitting there at the side of the gym watching now with a little more interest as the new champion began to posture. The man saying as he moved himself from side to side like a dog preparing itself to bite. 	“Some people have big mouths – some people win belts - there’s a difference - you know what I mean?”And I told him straight back.	“Some people get paid to let you win.” Which wasn’t at all an exaggeration of the truth, as after we’d left the temple, and were heading to the gym, May had explained to me exactly how it all worked. 	“It’s not to unlike these guys in Pattaya punching above their weight with the women. The girls there sell them the fantasy that they’re great lovers and handsome and in the end some begin to believe it. Well it’s the same here, these kids and young men come over here to learn how to fight. They pay the gym tens of thousands of dollars for food and accommodation and the opportunity and privilege of being trained for a year or three by the best. Obviously there’s the young men who genuinely want to become better fighters, better warriors. Young men who take the skills learned here back home and progress enough to fight in these cages like they do… And then there are the others. The ones who believe the dream they are being sold. The ones the bar girls like to play with. These are the ones that when the gym has squeezed as much money out of them, they suddenly become good enough to get the opportunity to fight for a title - that they will always win.”	And Lee Wilkes had paid enough, trained enough, and fucked enough of the local girls for his ego to be worthy of headlining at such a venue. The guy winning some synthetic title fight only for his ego to take beating later that evening. Now cops or no cops, the man had a point to prove and that point was to knock out a big fuck like me in front of all who had worshipped him as the king of the gym he was.	      And as those words slipped easily from my mouth, and I called him out as the phony and paper tiger he was, Lee Wilke’s temper flared and he came at me fast with a double spinning kick that caught me square in the mouth and send myself and the little fella crashing to the floor.       Now if I said to you that the kick didn’t hurt and that the only reason I could not block it was that I was holding the dog, that would be untrue. For the man had been trained very well, despite all the bullshit back of the truck razzmatazz that had been thrown in during his three years here in Thailand. And that training had taken out my front teeth. 	Stunned I lay there on the floor and felt the chain of my new lucky amulet across my lips like a horses bit. The taste of iron from the blood which now poured into my mouth from where my front teeth used to be. The cops there before me, looking on curiously as they smoked their cigarettes. May in shock horror,  Steve in disbelief. Lee Wilkes standing over me as though he was the new Mohamed Ali and I was his Sonny Liston as his girl Sherri looked on. Only Sonny Liston never got up. 	Spitting out my front teeth, I then stood and stared at Lee Wilkes as he mouthed off and postured in front of me. Saying the likes off, “fuck with me motherfucker” and “I kill you motherfucker” as he pointed and twisted his hand and fingers towards my face. Unconsciously I reached up to my chest and feeling the new gold amulet around my neck and pulled its chain from my mouth. So much for good luck?I then moved towards him. Feigned him with a right that he began to cover and then as he did I caught his arm with my left hand and grabbing his shirt with my other, dipped down and in a judo move my father had taught me to perfection, I threw the man hard across my back sending him spinning through the air and into the side of the boxing ring.       Then I waited for him to get up. The man winded, scrambling to his feet, jumping in his training shoes with the muscles in his shaved legs flexed. I stepped forward as he instinctively came at me again, the man breathing out hard with every blow as he punched, jabbed and kicked with skill and purpose. Each blow landing on my arms and legs with force as I blocked, out maneuvering every one as it came. Then working out his system and timing which wasn’t far removed from the ginger haired kids, I waited. Watching and listening to his breathing, closing out everything until all that was around me was just myself and this man.       Then he came again, jabbing, swinging and kicking in the same precise and practiced moves. One, one, two, two, kick. Backing off slightly, I waited. The man strong and fit, even if he had fought a title fight the evening prior. Then he came again. One, one, two, two, kick…. Wait, then again One, one, two, two, kick. Only this time, on the last kick I knew he’d be open, and that is exactly when I planted my size eleven into the inside of his standing left foot. Then bringing my left fist through with whip and pace, I caught him on the side of his jaw as his leg buckled below him, bringing him to ground.        As soon as he was down, I was on him, quickly cradling him with my body from behind. Spinning, I wrapped my legs around his neck and holding his right arm, I stretched it out and away from his body as I choked him out until his body went limp. Lee Wilkes, after he’d become the champion he’d trained so hard to be, really wasn’t having the after party he had been expecting.       Standing I looked to the two policemen who had not moved. The two of them still sitting expressionless. Watching on as they smoked. Neither two giving a flying fuck as to what they’d just witnessed. Then I looked to Steve and around the gym until I saw May looking to me with her hand to her mouth. Then to Lee Wilkes still unconscious on the ground. Rushing to me May held her hand out and looked at my teeth. Then she looked to Lee Wilkes lying on the ground alone. His girl Sherri not crouched beside him tending his wounds. The girl again, long gone. In disgust. May said to herself.	“What have I done? What have I done? This was my fault, I should never have bought you here.”But it wasn’t her fault, it was mine and mine alone. 					****************      With myself turning down all offers to go to the hospital or dentist we arrived back at the hotel. Steve and Le now sitting in the back and the little fella sitting on May’s lap.       At least I had him back. I unconsciously ran my tongue across the space where my front teeth used to be. May still in a state about it. Steve enjoying my new look and saying with glee.	“when you got a mouth like yours, that had to happen. Bit of more than you could chew I think.” But I hadn’t. This Wilkes guy being good, Well trained and all, but I had fought better opponents in my day. My father being one. I said, closing the door and scooping down to pick up the puppy, feeling the pain in my mouth as I did. 	“I bet you tonight, your new girl will be wishing it was you with the missing teeth.”					*****************With both of us splitting off to our separate beach chalets May and I sat ourselves down on the deck and looked out across the water. May still in deep remorse saying.	“This has to be the worse trip of my life.”I smiled. For me it was the best ever. I’d found the girl I’d been looking for who’d stolen my money - I’d found my puppy - and I was sitting alone on a deck next to a gorgeous turquoise watered beach with a beautiful girl, who for some reason wanted to be with me. Seriously what could be better. I said.	“I’ve had worse.”	“Really?” May asked. Yeah, like the day my father died.	“Back in Alberta, things got tricky there to.” I said as I thought back to that single gunshot as it pierced the silence and destroyed not just my father but us all.	“You want to tell me?” May asked sincerely in a quiet tone. I didn’t. So I said, as I sucked air through the large chasm where my front teeth used to be.      “Yeah, like the day my father died.”      Fuck.And with those words May just looked at me waiting perhaps for more to come and when it didn’t she simply said. 	“Look at it this way - some dentist will be happy.” Before she carried on taking me by surprise by saying.	“That girl there with that guy you knocked out. She have a thing with your brother?”I looked at her.	“You saw that hey?”If she saw what I’d seen, then she had. The slight looks between the two of them as soon as Sherri entered the room. The way Sheri had looked at Le - then at May.	“It’s a girl thing.” May said as I wondered what I had perhaps missed as I’d had other things to consider. I said, 	“Yeah, small world. You bitches see shit.” You bitches? I then waited, tasting the blood that still seemed to dripping from where my front teeth once sat. Had May picked up on that one? There was little doubt she’d missed it. But yeah, she was correct, it was a small world. I couldn’t deny that. With myself coming to Pattaya, looking for my brother. Meeting May. Looking for my brothers girl. Finding her here hanging out with a wanna be Mai Thai hero. The man fighting at the same venue May and her sister were working at. Conspiracy? There certainly could be. Having a suspicious mind like I had it was something that you couldn’t count out. You did need though to tread careful around this kind of thing. I knew that much. Relationships are fragile things. No one needed to go accusing anyone of anything when it could be just a coincidence.  What I needed to do was find out just how well my new girl knew this Lee Wilkes character. If at all. So I said.	“You fucking that loser as well or what?”She wasn’t, the look on her face as soon as those words left my lips told me that. Along with the tears that followed. But somehow they were connected, and they were connected in a way I was yet still unable to understand.  										************      It’s a strange thing to lose your front teeth. Growing up around ice hockey in Canada having a wayward smile seemed as though it was almost a rite of passage. So far I had been lucky enough to have only lost molars. Now though I knew how all the other kids had felt as teens growing up as my tongue swept around my mouth for the millionth time. May saying as she wiped the tears from her eyes.	“I leave tomorrow, but I can go now if that’s how you feel?”It wasn’t how I felt and having met the first decent women I’d ever met in my life, I did not want her to leave. I needed to try to curb the words that seemed to flow so easily from my now fucked up mouth. So I said as I eyed the absence of life on the deck of Steve’s chalet room with suspicion.	“You think my brothers fucking your sister in there?”May looked at me for a moment and then to the chalet opposite.	“More like the other way.”That one took me by surprise.	“It’s the way she is.” May then carried on saying in a precise and thought out manner, “the girl likes to fight and you know….fuck, and not necessarily in that order, if you excuse my language. It’s the reason I’m here holding up round cards at stupid Muay Thai venues, instead of living in Bangkok making real money doing TV commercials for the Japanese. It’s a choice I made when Le was offered the job at Tiffany’s. Be a model and travel the world, or go live in that cesspool they call Pattaya with her. Someone needs to keep her from getting drunk and catching disease working the ladyboy bars she’d inevitably end up in. So, as I say, here I am. And for the record, no I’m not in a relationship with that man. I’ve seen him at venues, but believe me, he’s not my type. Hopefully I never see him again. We are only here to work, and I thought it would be nice to come see you. Which is a choice I now regret.” 	Sitting there, I looked to this beautiful woman I did not deserve. The girl, I’d fell in love with the instant I’d seen her twist her way through traffic on her little red Vespa. This same girl now with shaking hands, giving out long speeches as she bared her soul to me. Her sister was obviously as big as a problem to her as my brother was to me. The girl having drawn first blood the night before and then gone down to the gym the next day to finish the job. Somehow I needed to clear the air, get things back on track and forget about everything that had happened before and move forward, if I could. So I said.	“You really think she’s fucking Steve?”Taking a deep breath, May looked toward my brothers chalet. Then looking to the turquoise sea she said without looking back.	“My sister is not one for laying down, same for most of these ‘girls’ put it that way.” Well there was a thing. It was the other way around. All this talk I’d heard from guys on the rigs who’d spent there off time out here. Sprouting off, saying shit like –‘Just flipped em over.’ When they’d discovered a girl was smuggling a budgie downstairs. When truth was they were probably the ones being flipped. Especially if the girl could fight the way Le could. But that was Steve’s business not mine. And I wasn’t going to say another word about it. Not to him or anyone for that matter. It’s not as though he was alone in the room with some guy, he’s in there with a girl every bit as beautiful as May. Then as if on cue, Steve stepped out of the Chalet onto the deck holding a can of beer. Seeing me he raised it in cheer. So I said, 	“How’s your ass?” To which he said straight back. 	“Same shape as your teeth.”      Same as my teeth - all smashed up. 							***************            I headed down the beach with the little fella running at my side. My big boots making foxholes in the sand. May needing a break from it all. The girl now getting some rest.      She was, despite my protest, taking the entire incident on her own shoulders. But what had she done other than to come here and see me. Had she called the guy a stupid cunt in the gym and when he was advertising the fight on the back of that truck as I had?  No. Had she gone out drinking with my brother and kicked the guy in the face in a bar? No she hadn’t. She had though bought the cops over to the gym when she’d wanted retribution for the ginger haired lads antics towards her sister. Which in itself was fair enough. Even if Le had lashed out with the first blow. But now she was getting some beauty sleep, not that she needed any. Or so I’d thought she was.  	I reached the end of the beach and turned back. Passing the couples and families playing in the crystal clear water. The women and children who’d seemed to have never seen a puppy before coming back for a second look on our return. The jet ski owners touting their bullshit inflated rates trying to fleece me of my hard earned money knowing better than to ask me twice on my return.       Nodding hello to a Thai man with long hair and tattooed arms standing on the beach at the water’s edge close to my chalet as I passed, I headed up the beach to find Sherri sitting on the deck, talking to May. May looking to me as I’d stopped in the sand in surprise. The beautiful woman giving the slightest of shakes of her head telling me to stay away whilst the girl sat there crying before her.       I looked to the first chalet I’d rented which Steve had now commandeered to see the curtains again closed. Then I took a quick look back down the beach in the direction I had just come from to see the man who’d been standing by the water’s edge no longer there. Moving myself out of May and Steve’s ex fiancés eyeline, I sat myself down under a tree and waited. Looking out across the clear blue water. Watching the small waves as they lapped up onto the beach. What the fuck does she want again. All that I had thought about was finding her and the return of my money for so long, but now I had to admit due to everything, the money had been the last thing on my mind. Why? I’m not sure, maybe it really didn’t matter that much as I now had Steve under my wing again and ultimately I knew he’d eventually pay me back. Despite the protests. Three months at minus 30 on a rig in northern Alberta would see to that. Easy money if you weren’t the person putting in the time. That’s what I needed to do. Let his visa run out then send him back to work on the first flight. Then hang out here. Get a rental to live in and drink coffee and hang at the beach all day. Be a pseudo version of the many wives who drove their expensive SUV’s about in Fort McMurray or Grande Prairie. Going to coffee with their other oil rig worker wife friends whilst their husbands pulled in the coin. All wearing their Canada Goose parkas, flaunting their false nails and even more fake titties.      And when he was done. If I liked it, I’d stay, and that would be that. Of coarse I’m not saying I’m rich, I’m not saying that I had what it takes in the bank to retire. But I did have enough tucked away that I could last a while. Even if the bitch sitting on my hotel chalet deck had taken a chunk.       The first thing May said when I saw that this Sherri girl had gone and I’d returned was.      “I don’t like associating with those type of girls.” And I couldn’t blame her. Then she said. 	      “And she told me what you asked her to do.”That one threw me and in panic, I said,	“She’s the one who asked me to come on her tits.” 	“ Sorry?” May replied.  Then said, “About the money, she said you want her to return the money.”	“Oh?”	“Well, she doesn’t have it. But she has told me where you can find the guy who does.”	“The husband?”	“Yes…. And she’s scared, because he’s a very bad person and that’s why she became close with that idiot Muay Thai guy. She says she only came to Pattaya when this Wilkes man went back to Florida for a couple of months. That’s when she met Steve.”	“Okay?”	“She’s now more scared of the cops.”	“Why?” I asked. Then working it out for myself asked.  “The ones at the gym you arranged, spooked her?”	“Yes, I arranged them to be there to charge that boy with assault. She thinks they were there for her. That’s why she disappeared as soon as the fight started. Anyway, those cops spooked her as you put it, so strangely it worked out. Now she wants to fix everything. All the girl keeps saying is that it wasn’t her. Says the husband got into her bank and withdrew the money. He’s in the north, he works there, brings guys across the Mekong river from Laos to ‘party’ on a boat. Apparently it’s where they met.”      But this husband wasn’t in the north, he was here in Samui and it had been him with the long hair and tattoos hanging about waiting a couple of hundred yards along the beach.    					Chapter Eight      Saying our goodbyes, we dropped the two girls at the airport then drove to the ferry to take us back to the mainland. Steve now confused. The young man staying silent for almost the whole crossing. Only getting going again once we hit the highway and headed back towards the north. The road seemingly now more dangerous than it had been when we’d headed south. Steve eventually saying, 	“We should have bought Sherri with us.”Oh god not again!	“Sherri’s got a guy, you forget that?” I replied in in an irritated tone.	“You said she was with him cos she was scared.”I had yes. I’d told him what Sherri had said whilst he was getting frisky with a ladyboy a couple of chalets along the beach. But now, if this was going to be his ongoing monologue I wish I hadn’t. 	“I should call her see if she’s alright.”	“Don’t.”	“Why?”	“Just don’t…. Anyway I thought you had a new girl?”Steve thought about that one as he stared out the window at the trees as we passed. Then just said.	“Nah.”	“Why not?” I replied, “She’s prettier than the last one, and stronger. Marry her instead and she can help you with the shopping.”Steve laughed, then looked to me and my missing teeth looking like a defence man from the National Hockey League. Then looking back to the road he said with confidence. 	“Just friends that’s all”	“That’s all?”	“Yeah, friends.”	“And?” 	“And what?”	“You fuck her?”	“No?” 	“Why?”	“She’s got a dick. That’s why.” Steve snapped back, the guy now obviously uncomfortable. Then he said, 	“She did try though.”And she had tried, the same as any young single guy would try it on if he was left in a room with a pretty single girl. Le, moving in close, making eye contact as she talked, grinning as she did in a way that could only mean she wanted one thing. Then he said. 	“Well you know I’m not going to lie, that girls hot and she did keep on so in the end I let her suck me off.”I thought as much, There was no way the two of them could have been in that room alone for as long as they had been and they’d just played chess. I said. 	“You kinky fuck.”	“What about you, you can talk?” Steve then said back quickly. “That girl you fawning over is no different, look at them they twins.”He wasn’t wrong, the two girls looked the same. But he wasn’t right either, they weren’t the same. Le being a scrapper who’d just stepped out of a poster at the local Victoria Secret store to have a fight. And then May who had just the same beauty but not the same male XY chromosome as her sister. Steve said. 	“Your girls got a dick, I’m sure, you just not like me and too shy to admit it.”But she didn’t, I was pretty sure of that. Not that I was one hundred percent sure. Being that the girl had kept her shorts on whilst we’d been together. Nonetheless sticking to my own theory, I said,	“She hasn’t.” 	“Maybe she had it chopped off?” Steve asked.Then showing off my toothless mouth, I laughed. I was getting to know this woman and she was very honest in every way. The girl wearing her heart on her sleeve the way she did. It seemed to me that I’d know by now if she’d had anything, including surgery. Besides, there was one big factor that I had yet to mention to my brother. 	“Well, she’s got a kid, so fuck off.”	“Dads have kids. Our dad had two.” Our Dad. 	“You seen her snatch?” Steve then suddenly asked before I could change the subject. And with a big smile on my face I had to admit that I hadn’t. Not even on that first night we were together. Which I couldn’t remember anyway. 	“No,” I replied, 	“what?” Steve replied. The young man unable to comprehend my words and carried on saying. 	“What you been doing then?”      “Kissing - May said, If I love you, you can kiss me. So things are moving forward.”That line confusing my brother as it rolled of my lips and then unravelled itself in his brain. Then once he understood, he said. 	“You don’t always have to kiss when you fuck, you know that right?”And they say romance is dead.					***************      By late afternoon we had hit the outskirts of Bangkok. Filling up and eating meals from stalls from the PTT stations on the way. The little fella getting quickly into the routine. Knowing when to take a piss and when to sleep. Steve doing the same. Myself feeling the space where my teeth used to be with my tongue as I shouted at all these crazies in their cars and supped up trucks that shared the road.       Looking to Steve as we hit the toll road that would take us around Bangkok. The man just waking. Watching him as he wiped the dribble from his mouth, I said.	“I counted twelve dead dogs so far.”And I had, the poor things lying at the kerbside either fresh or rotting in the heat.	“Thanks for that.” Steve replied as he looked to the little fella as he slept on my lap. 	“You’re welcome.”	“Why’d you come out with shit like that and think I want to hear it?”	“I don’t.” I said straight back, wondering where this was going.	“You got some kind of morbid thing going on with dead animals.”	“Is that right?” I answered wishing now I’d just stayed quiet. 	“Yeah.”	“Well it’s either dead dogs or that money you lost. So take your choice.” I quickly said back. Then he sat quiet as he always did. But while we were on the subject, I said.	“And don’t be going thinking you’re going to get back with that whore because you’re not.”	“Your dad now then are you?” He asked as he looked out the window to the city now spread all around us. 	“Someone has to be.”					***************      By the time the sun had rose again we had hit the bank of the mighty Mekong river. The Lao’s People’s Democratic Republic as they like to be called laying to the east just the other side. It’s buildings riding up from the river bank easily a mile in the distance sitting at the edge of the fast flowing body of water rushing its way out towards the south china sea.      We found a hotel on the rivers bank on the Thai side and settled in. The room coming at premium with king size bed and the convenience of a hot tub on the balcony. The place secret and secluded, with its million dollar view across the water. Standing on the balcony I looked out over the river as it flowed, dragging debris in its wake. The air here cooler than the south. 	“Where are we? Steve asked. It was a good question. We were in the district of Chiang Mai. One of Thailand’s northern most provinces. Sitting now in a couples hotel with its dreamy view. A thousand plus odd Miles from Samui, and a million miles from my home in Calgary and if I was honest, right now, it still was not far enough. 	I woke up in the mid-afternoon to find again the aircon running full blast. The balcony door wide open and Steve sitting in the hot tub with the little fella. The tiny puppy appearing half its size with its drenched fur pushed flat against its skin. It’s little eyes looking to me as it heard me wake and rise. Steve saying as soon as I stood looking to the empty plates and beer cans sitting on the rooms small dining table. 	“Got room service for us both but I ate it all. So if you wanna eat you can call because I think they think we’re a couple of fags”	“It’s because of the dog.” I said back. I went to the bathroom and took a piss. It had been a long drive and it had taken it out of me. I was still tired. On top of that, my mouth was hurting bad. I said,	“Call them and get some pain killers would you.”	“From in here?” Steve shouted back from the balcony. The pricks voice sounding as though I’d just asked him to climb a mountain.	“Well get out then.” I snapped back as I watched my urine hit the water below. Steve lowering his tone and saying . 	“It’s not my fault you got no teeth - let the guy kick you in the chops like that. Should have been more aware of your surroundings.”And wasn’t that the truth. 	“What would you know?” I said back as I finished and walked to the sink and washed my hands. The thought of everything that I should have done to stop myself losing my front teeth had been a constant since it had happened. Bottom line though my big mouth was the common denominator that it always boiled down too. So I said. 	“It was only a matter of time. If it wasn’t him it would have ended up being someone else.”	“Maybe me?”Maybe?The kid was lucky he still had his for all the times in my life the man had pissed me off. But here I was still there holding out some imaginary sword. Covering for him in one form or the other. I walked to the balcony and reaching down pulled the little fella from the bubbling hot tub water. The puppy hot and shaking now in my hands as I held him. 	“You shouldn’t be doing that.” I said. “He doesn’t like it.”	“Just doing uncle shit,” Steve said back, “he needs to learn to swim.”I picked up Steve’s towel and wrapped the little fella in it. Dried him, and threw it to the floor. Then putting the dog down I looked out towards the river. Somewhere out there May had told me this Sherri had told her was a party boat that docked shoreside in Vientiane on the Laos side of the water. The boat moving out after dark and anchoring up in the rivers centre. Where it would wait for another boat to pull alongside and dock. One from Laos and the other from this side of the river in Thailand. This could happen anywhere in this region of the river in either direction. Five or so miles north or south from where we were situated. Maybe, if what this little lying whore that my brother had been hoping to marry was telling the truth. So I waited. 					******************      By the time evening had come I’d taken a shower and eaten, fed the little fella, and taken him down in the SUV to stand on the banks of the raging Mekong. Him there sniffing around at my feet as I stared at the city lights of Vientiane on the other side. It’s tall buildings bathed in sun. From what I could see there was no party boat moored up on the other side and nothing on this side for that matter.             Maybe it was bullshit, Maybe this Sherri girl had just sent us north with a garbage story. It was possible. The girl didn’t have the greatest track record for honesty. So sitting myself back in the seat at the wheel of my huge gas guzzling vehicle I sat and waited. The thoughts of the last few days since I’d arrived in this country buzzing around my brain. Alberta and my father interrupting any decent memories that floated through. The words of that cop Soone who had travelled all that way to Chumphon to talk to me in my head. May thankfully interrupting them all with a phone call. She said as I answered.	“You up? It’s late, I just finished work.” 	“Yes, I’m up. I’m out with the little fella, getting him some air.”	“I’m sure he won’t care where he is as long as he’s with you.” That was true, Then May asked.	“How’s your mouth?” 	“Have I upset anyone, is that what you mean?”	“No, are you in pain still?”	“A bit - feels different though.”	“I’m sure it does - I’ve spoken to a dentist, he can do implants. Swiss implants, not the Chinese type. He’s good.”	“What’s the point, someone’ll only knock them out again.” I said as a joke and knowing there was an element of truth to my words.	“Let us hope not.” May answered with a smile in her voice. Then she asked.	“How’s Steve?”	“In the hot tub probably.”	“You have a hot tub?”	“Big one on the balcony. And you were right about him and your sister.”	“Doesn’t surprise me.”	“Surprised me.” I said, and it had. 					***************      It was just after midnight and just as I was about to give up and put the car into gear to pull away that I saw it. The long party boat on the far side of the river with its glass windows moving down stream with the current. Watching as it passed me, I stared out at the boats running lights as it moved silently in the water. Leaving my headlights off, I pulled away from where I’d sat waiting and watching. Following along, some five hundred yards behind. 	Reaching a turn in the river it stopped. The boat laying anchor as the current stretched its chain and moved the boat at will. Then almost as if it had been sitting waiting somewhere in the darkness as I had, a smaller boat, unlit and hidden in the gloom, headed out of the bank, crossed the river and pulled itself up on the blind side.  	I sat there, it seemed for the longest time. Myself looking out across the water at a boat that did nothing more than just sit there at anchor with certainly no party going on. Then just before two a.m. I heard the sound of an engine and saw the small boat as it appeared again. Pulling away from the larger vessel and disappearing into the night . The party boat releasing its anchor as it’s engine blew hard. Pushing itself out and turning in a large circle, as it headed back up stream.					*************	      So the young lady had been correct. No lies this time. For once. The party boat was there, but was the husband with it? That was the question.  I headed back to the hotel and as soon as I opened the door to the room I saw Steve still sitting in the hot tub. 	“You’ll turn into a prune.” I said as I put the little fella on the ground. 	“You see that boat?” Steve asked as he sat there with his arms out of the water, stretched out either side, resting on the tubs side, bubbles around his chin.	“No.” I answered, lying.	“I did, you should have stayed here. Sat in here with me.”	“No thanks, don’t want to catch herpes.”	“You already got it.”Good one, But I didn’t have it. That or anything else, bar a mental health issue that wouldn’t allow me to keep my trap shut. And of course, now a mouth with what felt like half its teeth missing.	“So you going boating?” Steve then asked.And boating I would be going, that was certain. But first I needed a boat. 					***************	The next morning I went and bought myself some water and food, and some binoculars from the Big C shopping centre. Then I went and found myself a paddle board from some outdoor adventure store. I knew that there was a high chance the boat would moor itself in the same spot as it had the night before. Steve’s ex fiancé telling us roughly where it would be and she had not been wrong. So why should things change?       Leaving the little fella in the capable hands of Steve I set off just before dusk and dropped the paddle board off by the side of the river. Discretely hiding it within some reeds.       I then looked around for some visual markers that I could see once it got dark. An old post holding a rusty sign written in Thai close to an even older abandoned shack which years before had lost it’s door. Leaving myself a visual marker consisting of  a ribbon tied to the post. I jumped into the SUV and turning around headed down stream. 	With the area in sight where I’d seen the boat moor up the previous evening, I kept on driving. Travelling along the side of the river as I looked to speedometer and caught the millage. A mile later I found a place to park the car close to a naturally formed beach and with a bottle of water in hand I locked up and began the journey back on foot. 	Keeping my head down I carried on. Heading upstream as the small parade of love hotels came and went. Looking up and seeing the balcony where Steve would no doubt be relaxing in the hot tub as I passed. Then the road became quiet and by the time I’d arrived at the old shack it was dark again. 	Waiting as a car passed, I watched its tail lights fade far into the distance before I  slid myself down the river bank and sat at the waters edge. The current there lapping at the stones as the water passed before me. Sitting down on a rock I waited. The air cooler as I rested by the water. The countless mosquitos tickling the rear of my legs and ears as they looked for a place to land. Fuck it though, What did I expect, it was all part of the process. What did I think was going to happen if I sat out by a river in the tropics at dusk. Northern Alberta would be worse. But back home there was no Malaria, or Dengue fever and all the other shit these little fuckers had the pleasure of carrying.       Then I thought of Steve, sitting up there on the balcony, no doubt with a beer soaking himself silly in the bubbling water. Slowly broiling in that big tub as I sat down here sorting out his mess.       Then at just around eleven I saw it again. The faint lights of the party boat moving towards me in the far distance through the darkness of night. Standing, I pulled the new paddle board out from the reeds, took a decent swig of my water and with the boards leash in my hand I cast it off into the river. Taking the board into its grip, the current quickly took a hold of the eight foot by three foot slab of expensively shaped and coated foam. Straining my arm I felt the tug from the rivers water. Then pulling it back to the rocks beneath my feet I crouched down and waited for the boat to get close and eventually pass.       Although it had to be at least a half mile away in the rivers centre, the boat looked closer now as it reached me. The party vessel passing by in ominous silence. Travelling just that little bit faster than the current to maintain control. Then just as the party boat had glided itself back into darkness, with my paddle in hand I stepped onto the board, kneeled down and allowed the current take me away. Gently dipping my paddle into the turbulent water, I guided myself towards the rivers centre.       Letting the current do all the work except steer, I followed the party boats fading wake. In no time at all I passed the hotel where for the moment Steve, the little fella and I called home. And as the lights of the building sent multi coloured streams across the water I wondered if Steve had spotted me as I believed I had him.       Now you may think a manoeuvre like this one, fucking about on the Mekong as I were in the middle of the night would be tricky and perhaps hazardous to one’s health and wellbeing. But knowing me now as no doubt you do, then perhaps you’d understand that I have a tendency to not care. Obviously a childhood of riding the fast flowing wild and turbulent Bow River for miles in exactly the same manner as it wound itself through the city of Calgary was great in preparation for such a feat. Feeling the cold off the glacier fed waters every summer as a kid definitely helped. Back then when there’d been a family of sorts. My father leading the way. All three of us life jacketed up. Steve in the centre. My father and I flanking his sides. My mother in the rubber dingy with a little flask and sandwiches that tasted so good at the end of each and every journey following on as we passed through parks and under bridges in the sunshine for what seemed like an age. 	This time though, the water was not as cold and there was no life jacket to save me from drowning, or sandwiches waiting for me at the other end. I was on a mission and although the party boat was around a quarter of a mile in front of me, I was right on it’s tail. Feeling the river lap at my knees and legs, I carried on paddling for one moment and steering the next until in the distance I saw that the boat had slowed and I was getting closer. 	Swinging the oar from side to side I guided myself towards the boats rear and then faster than I thought it would be, I was suddenly right on it.       With the river pushing me forward I hit the boats stern, and watched the water as it churned beneath the boat. The paddle board wedging it’s nose against the crafts steel. Then as the waters current spun the board around pushing the side of the board against the vessels hull. I reached up and grabbing the bottom rung of the side rail, I pulled myself up. Twisting my body, I then bought my left foot in the air, digging the toe of my boot under the rail as the paddle board moved off from beneath me to leave me hanging.       And there I stayed for a moment as I questioned my life choices and thought of Steve, no doubt with his eyes closed. Tugging his dick as he laid alone in the big hot tub. The fast moving water racing below me. The sound of the anchor chain pulling as it’s steel links strained. 	Hauling myself up I dragged myself over the rail and stood on the deck. The rivers cool wind blowing in my hair. My legs and feet dripping wet. The boat dark at its stern. The glass windows blacked. I moved forward to look inside. The window glass dirty, almost opaque with grime. There were people inside and they were foreigners from what I could tell. Maybe eight in total. Maybe ten. All lounging about speaking in a language that sounded German. Sinking down I dropped to my knees and wetting my finger slowly cleared a fingertip piece of grime from the outside of one of the window panes. Yes they were Germans or from that region. All cleanly dressed and looking like clones with matching black T Shirts that read, Bavarian Christian Mission Group. 	So missionary’s maybe. The group of men all middle aged and soft in their features with their leather sandals and shorts. Some wearing backpacks, others with leather bum bags sitting on their hips. I stood and looked around, wondering where the boats captain and whoever the deck hand was could be. Then I heard a door open and through the window on the other side of the boat I saw movement as a man passed, heading out towards the vessels bridge.       I moved forward and through the bridges open door sneaked a look at the captain. The man there fiddling with his switches as the engine came to a rest. The deck hand collecting his rope, readying himself for the smaller boat to arrive.       Peering through the darkness of the river I then saw it. The small boat moving against the current as the water lapped at its bow. One of the men on either this boat or the one which would be joining us shortly would be the husband who had my money. But which one it was I did not know and in truth, now I was on board either way it did not matter.	Then I heard them, these Christian soldiers. Their voices now raised in excitement as the small boat came into view, drew closer and pulled alongside. These Christian saviors doing their bit for the lord as they travelled through Lao. All ignoring the fact they were outnumbered one thousand to one by a different faith. Calling upon schools and hospitals, handing out their kindness in the form of monetary exchange. Dropping of their currency and bibles to the needy in the slenderest hope that for each and every soul they saved via change in worship would bring them one step closer to their lord. 	But there was always another side to the coin, and it was one which Christians or not needed to be addressed. A basic need that fuels in one form or the other the motivation for so many things in this world we live in. A hunger which here in this boat they could consume. This need to touch and be touched. And as they felt the two boats collide whilst the smaller boat docked alongside with a soft thud. The select few evangelists of the Bavarian Christian Mission Group congregation, with their matching T shirts tucked neatly into the Khaki shorts, all cheered in glee. As after delivering all their saintly sermons and dispensing their reverent acts of god, they knew they had finally arrived at the place they all had truly come all this way to be. Alone and far away from the prying eyes of loyal subjects and pious elders. Far away from their devoted wives and congregations tucked away in the small villages and towns in the foothills of the southern alps. They now knew they could get down to it again and get on with some good old fashioned fucking. Only the passengers being bought in on the small boat that the husband I’d been looking to find were not women. But instead children and every person waiting or facilitating their arrival on that boat was soon to have a big problem, and that problem was me.  					Chapter Nine:        I waited in silence, curbing the anger I felt brewing inside as I watched the young children dressed in badly sewn adult clothes purposely made to palate the fulfilment of these creatures that waited excitedly within.       Then I saw him, the man who in my mind had to be the only one of the three Asian men who stood the chance of being this girl Sherri’s husband. The same man I’d seen waiting on the beach only a day or so before. The man with his long hair and tattooed arms.       The man ushering off the children from his small boat one at a time. Showing zero remorse for the horrors that would be inflicted upon them by these reverent men who claimed to know god. 	Keeping to the shadows I moved along the deck and waited at the side of the boats bridge doorway for the next person who would step out and be dispatched. The first being the captain of the party boat. The man stepping out and lighting a smoke as he stood there all sweaty and bare chested in his shorts and flip flops. The man listening to his fellow crew as they chatted back and forth in Lao. The captain without a care, ignoring the crying children as they stood scared at the bow of his boat.       Creeping up behind him I wrapped my arms around his neck using a Port Alberni chokehold I’d learned from my father. Feeling the sweat of the man’s chest and neck drip onto my arms I held him there as he kicked out with his feet until he’d stopped breathing. Then with the man barely alive laying beneath me I stood still and waited, listening to the children cry and the missionaries within quietly talk nervously amongst themselves. 	Then just as I was about to say fuck it and go in myself and dispatch the rest, the deck hand stepped through the door out onto the deck. The man looking down to the boat captains body lying motionless and before he could call out to his remaining colleague inside he’d found himself like his friend unable to breathe with my forearm stuck hard against his windpipe. With the man still trapped in my arms I quickly maneuvered him to the edge of the boat and dropped him into the black water below.   	Then looking up I saw him, as he stood at the bow of the boat now looking straight at me with the Captains body laying between us. The look of terror and disbelief upon his face. This man who Sherri claimed to be her husband. This repugnant being, built of an evil far beyond anything I had ever comprehended before.       The man who without feeling, fed from the desperate, the weak and the poor. Manipulating them via incomprehensible financial or violent threats to give up their children. This man who had coveted and seduced the love of my brother’s life as a child so many years before.       Without a moment of hesitation I ran at him, treading on the head of the captain as I went. The husband moving quickly through the cover of the crying children as he fled. The man leaping from one boat into the next as I followed. Throwing myself over the side of the party boat and into his. I landed with a thump onto the wet and oily deck. Sherri’s husband moving quickly to the rear of his small boat. Quickly I then stood, just in time to see him burst from the small boats cabin with a sawn off shotgun. The man letting off one blast after the another as I jumped from one side of the boat to the next as the shot pellets whipped past me through the air. Then as he cracked the shotguns neck to reload I was up and on him again, racing down the boat in my big boots and cut down shorts. With my right leg planted firmly to the deck I pushed myself up as I neared his body as the man bought up his shotgun again to shoot. My left foot catching him in the base of his neck and knocking him to the floor. And it was at that point that I knew I had him.         Reaching down, I grabbed the man by his shirt and hit him square in the face. Once and then twice. The husband calling out in pigeon English as he felt the first blow hit home.	“Have money I you money…” But I no longer gave a shit about the money. So I hit him again. Then again as he called out. 	“Money, have money now.”Then behind me I heard movement, and it was the German’s crossing from the party boat into the smaller one, and they were coming for me. Letting go of the husband, I quickly turned, picked up the shotgun and seeing that there was two new cartridges loaded, I snapped the barrel shut. Then I let one barrel go, the shot blasting out and catching the lead German missionary straight into the centre of his nicely ironed and tucked in T-Shirt. The man flipping backwards off his feet and falling over the side of the boat with the blast from the gun. Then quickly I turned to see that the husband had gone. Fuck!I looked around as the rest of the terrified Germans backed off. There was no way the man could have gotten in front of me without me seeing him. With the gun still stretched out in one hand towards the German men, I looked to the dark water. Nothing. No one hanging onto the side of the boat looking back up through frightened eyes. Just black water. The man had to have taken his chances with the current and slipped overboard.       So I moved forward, the Germans backing off. Nervously climbing back onto the large party boat. Grabbing the children and holding them in front of themselves for protection as they went. With gun in hand I jumped up onto the rail of the small boat and still holding the shotgun to them all, I shouted. 	“Anyone one of you cunts still holding a child for protection when I drop onto your party boat dies.” And there was no doubting in the eyes of these men that I meant it. Then showing off my missing teeth, I bellowed out.      “One of you bring the kids back on here.”       “We are here for the children.” One of the German men said softly in a thick Bavarian accent. Wasn’t that the truth. The man standing there in his nicely ironed shorts and white shirt. The man looking saintly with his nicely groomed hair and soft features. The man carrying on, saying. “I am Han’s. We are here to help not harm.”So as he was so concerned. I chose him, nominating this savior of a man as the guy to move the kids. Han’s now speaking in a basic Lao and Thai mix that I could not follow. Ushering the children with such kindness and love you would think he was a boy scout cub master or even a catholic priest.       Once they were safe and standing on the deck behind me, shivering with fear in the rivers cool night air, I dropped myself down, shotgun in hand and shepherded the men, Han’s included around to the other side of the party boat.       They stood there, these men with their soft puppy eyes and skin. All looking back at me as I lauded over them with my big boots on. The men no longer joyous. Now as frightened as the children had been only moments before. Han’s saying as he stretched his arms to me in plea.      “You have this wrong sir, we are here for god, we are here to collect these children and bring them to a safe place.” I looked at them as I smiled with no teeth to show. Then said.      “Didn’t look like it before they arrived. Looked like you gonna put this party boat to good use.”      “No,” another said in his thick Bavarian accent. The rest of the group all nodding in agreement as he heard the man’s words slip nervously from his mouth.       “You are wrong sir - we  - we, are here to save these children. We did a deal to buy the children, to get them back. It was the only way it could be done.” And for a moment as I looked at these men with their frightened eyes I almost believed them. Looking to their backpacks and bum bags I said.      “Empty the shit out of them bags and if I see anything that tells me otherwise, you’ll be swimming back to church.”      But no one moved, no one stepped forward to slam the proof of their words in my face. No one there to show that they were on the right side of their god and he was there to help. Lifting the shotgun I aimed it at Han’s.       “You first, spokes guy, drop your shit out of your bum bag.”Slowly han’s dropped his hand and finding the bags zipper he slowly opened it up. Dipping his fingers in carefully and looking down, he pulled out a small bible first, then some hand sanitizer and some gum. Then he stopped. Staring at him I said. 	“And the rest.”Han’s stood there, looking back up at me now, shaking his head. Holding his hands up in desperation as he did. 	“That is it sir – there is nothing else. I swear on our almighty god.”Hearing his words, I leant forward and grabbing Han’s bag I ripped it violently from his waist. The small plastic clip buckle snapping. Breaking with ease from the force of my arm. Then lifting it in the air with one hand I turned it upside down and shook the rest of the contents free as condoms, lube, finger puppets and zip ties fell to the wooden deck at my feet. Looking to them all in disgust. I said. 	“Here’s your option, jump overboard and hope Jesus is there to help. Or stay here and let me kill you?”	The men from the Bavarian Christian Mission Group congregation all looked to each other and then to the dark water in terror as it run past the boat laid at anchor. Their spokesman Han’s saying quickly,	      “I cannot swim sir.”       “Should have learned.” I replied just as quickly back. Not giving a shit as I swung the shotguns short snub nosed barrel, gesturing it towards the water. Then said.	“Go – now –  before I start shooting.”Then from the back one German. Taking my word as gospel, must have had all his lifesaving swimming badges up to date and believed his lord Jesus, his holiness was there to protect him. As without a word he climbed the railing and taking his chances, jumped into the dark river below. The man hitting the water and sinking under as his fellow Christians watched on. The man sinking down, only to reappear five meters upstream. Caught in the moonlight as the current swept him along in the black water. The man’s arms spinning his body around to face the boat as the current took him away, until no one could see him at all. I said.	“See, look, easy-peasy. Off you go.”But I knew it wouldn’t be easy, far from it. Having swam in the Bow river enough. Feeling each time the currents pull and push. The water sapping your strength. Until there was little left to do other than to surrender yourself to the river. And that was with a life jacket on. I said again, this time with a voice that offered no room for debate.	“Off you go! Do it now, or like I say - die here.”	“Police?” one said, his voice meek and scared. “Call the police. Let them do their work.”But there would be no police for them to bribe and corrupt with their virtuous bullshit. Not today. So I simply said,	“you can sell your bullshit to them when you get to shore. And remember to tell them all about me.”      But they still wouldn’t move. So making the decision for them, I stepped forward again. Reaching out with my free hand I grabbed the first Christian soldier I could and pulling him forward, snapped my head into his and headbutting the man at the bridge of his nose, knocked him out cold. Then holding his limp body by one hand I lashed out my left leg in a quick Jiu Jitsu leg sweep and threw the man over board into the water. 	Not bothering to look back this time to watch him surface. I stared at the rest of the men, and asked.	“Who’s next?” And before they could answer, I’d grabbed another with my free hand and with another head butt and the same leg sweep, sent him reeling over the side. 	Seeing this, a Christian, taking his chances, climbed up and jumped in. Then another and another until all that was left was Han’s. The man, now standing there in complete fear as piss ran down his leg. Stepping forward and squashing the mans personal sex lube under my foot, forcing the man up against the party boats barrier as I went. Han’s unconsciously climbed, placing his ass  on the barriers metal rods rung by rung as he pushed up with his feet until he was sitting on the wooden side barriers top. He said,	“I will give you money.”      “I don’t want money, I want info. Your friends are as good as dead so you better tell me now before you join them.”  And hearing this, this man Han’s, who’d grown up in the Bavarian mountains started to cry and as he did he told me everything. And when he was done, without another word I reached forward and pushed him gently backwards off the edge.       Turning and with the shotgun in my hand I walked back around to the other side of the boat and looked to the children. Seeing them now properly for the first time as they looked back to me with as much terror in their little faces and eyes as the missionaries had just shown. They were young, real young, with not one of them I would say over ten years old. Girls and boys also. The girls wearing lipstick. Those sick fucks, As a rage passed through me and I looked back to the water in the hope there was just one, just one, still clinging on to the side of the boat who I could kill. Myself saying out loud to the black water. 	“I should have killed you all one by one with my bare hands. You fucking sick fucking cunts!” Then I turned to the children and with a shotgun in my hand, blood on my face and no teeth. I said.	“It’s okay, I’m not going to hurt you.”      Walking past the children without a word, I stepped into the boats small bridge and looked about. The key was in the ignition and a box of shotgun shells sat on the dash just above the boats wheel. Turning the key with one hand I picked up the shotgun cartridges with another and watched as the lights came on. Then with a twist of the key the engine started. Good stuff - almost there. I stepped back out, passing the kids at the back of the boat and looked around on the deck. Finding two full fuel canisters of fuel I picked them up and threw them over onto the deck of the party boat. Untying the small boat I was on, I then as we drifted away lifted the shotgun and blasted away at the canisters shot after shot until they both exploded, sending a ball of flame up into the nights sky.       				      *************** 	      Feeling the heat of the now burning party boat on my back, I walked to the helm of the small boat and drawing back on the boats throttle I felt the propeller engage and the boat pull forward as the light of the flames lit the way. 	Then I moved along, heading downstream, feeling the current pull me as I steered the boat back towards land. The kids in the back of the boat no longer crying and now silent. The low mellow sound of the engine and the lapping of the water as the boats bow cut though the dark river. The horror of the party boat lighting up the night sky now behind us all.	In what felt like an age but was only a minute or two, I saw the landmark I’d scouted from the shore and then the beach which lay exposed by low water close to the road where I’d parked my SUV.	With a spin of the wheel I felt the boat turn and then pushing the engine to full speed I headed straight towards shore with the aim of beaching the boat on the rounded pebbles and sand of the shoreline. And then I felt it, as the boats hull grounded home, cutting into the river bed below. Objects large and small, rigged and free rolling, all digging deep into the boats wooden slatted hull that had for so long stayed strong and intact. Now split apart by hard, sharp rocks bringing the boat to a cruel and destructive stop.      	Feeling the boat come to its rest and finding its own balance as it tilted itself and leant to one side, I rushed to the boats rear deck and grabbing the kids lifted them one by one over the side. Dropping them into the shallow water. Then worried I’d leave one behind I checked the boat again to find it empty. Jumping over the side I dropped down into the rivers water, feeling the crunch of the pebbles and sand beneath my heavy boots. Wading out I reached the children now standing on the beach. The kids wet and standing hand in hand. Still in fear. Looking up at me as they waited to see where I’d be taking them next. 	I lead them off the beach, treading in the sand as we passed through the darkness. The children catching their legs and feet on the weeds and rocks and washed up branches without a word of complain.       Climbing the river bank, I headed along the road as the kids followed silently behind, until I reached the place where I’d left my vehicle. Opening all the doors along the SUV’s rear I signalled for the children to all get in and handed out the bags of food and water I’d bought earlier. Starting the SUV, I then drove back upstream for a moment, all of us looking without a word to the boat across the water in what could only be Laos’s side of the border. The party boat burning out there like a centered feature glowing in the darkness.      I took a left, the cars headlights burning through the night. The road tight and twisting as it weaved its way through paddy fields and farm land. Then I saw it in the distance. It’s tall roof emblazoned in peaks of gold. It’s fierce dragons guarding it’s entrance way. Slowing I reached the drive and with a quick whip of my hand to the left I pulled off of the hard tarmacked surfaced road and felt the gravel on the temples driveway beneath.       ***************                   The sun was almost up when I arrived back at the hotel. Parking the SUV in the same spot it had been in when I had left. The place eerily quiet. The usually busy bar now closed. Passing the receptionist taking a sneak sleep behind the desk, I made it to the elevator and hit the button to the top floor. The corridor empty and as quiet as the downstairs had been. I reached the door to the small love suite and opening it I stepped inside to find Steve still sitting there in the hot tub only this time he was not alone and the person seated next to him in the bubbling water was a ladyboy.       Steve sitting there all smug with a huge grin across his chops. The man ignoring the girl sitting there naked with him. The girls long black hair wet, her fake titties covered in bubbles. I looked to the little fella fast asleep, snuggled into a big white towel. Then heard my brother saying as he nodded towards the river,	“you lucky you weren’t out there on that boat. They were letting off fireworks and then the whole thing blew up. You should have seen it.” 	Then before I could say a word, the ladyboy stood, letting the bubbles and bathwater drip from her body. Then without as much of a nod or a care for the stranger who had just joined them. She stepped out and with her titties jiggling and her engorged drooping dick swinging she walked off the balcony, passing me in the bedroom, and disappeared into the bathroom. Steve watching me as I watched her. Then hearing him say as I turned back,	      “What’s the matter with you, you never seen a girlie dick before?”      I hadn’t no, I then remembered the girl in the cat suit with the condom hanging off her penis. I said nonetheless,	“Not lately no.”	“Well you need to get out more.”Okay, that was it, that was my problem.	“Really?” I answered as I looked towards the bathroom as I heard the unmistakable sound of the lady standing as she took a piss from up high. I said,	“Make sure the seats up.”	“See you’re already seeing the positives.” Steve said back smiling. 	“Where the fuck did she come from anyway?” I asked as I heard the toilet flush.	“The bar.”	“What bar?”	“The one downstairs in the lobby.”	“Jesus Christ?” I said more in disbelief at the thought that Steve had been downstairs at the bar having a beer, whilst I’d been risking my neck pulling vigilante shit.	“Jesus wasn’t there.” Steve then said. 	“Yeah he’s keeping away from these parts at the moment it seems.”Thinking of the Christians in their matching T-shirts, I shook my head. I lifted the little fella to my chest and in my big boots I walked over to the large king size bed. Laying down, I closed my eyes. Hearing my brother say as I did. 	“take those boots off and have a bath before you get in there.” And all I managed to say back was.	“No - I might tread on your Lego.” But it wasn’t Lego I’d be treading on the next day it would be Laos because as soon as I woke up, that is exactly where we headed.					*************       We hit the friendship bridge which links Thailand with its neighbour Laos just after midday. Myself waking earlier to find the little fella snuggled into the crux of my armpit as I lay. I’d then gotten up and walked to the balcony. Steve there still in the hot tub. But this time alone. I asked.	“Where’s your friend?”	“Work.”	“I thought she was at work when she was here?”	“No that’s you that fucks hookers not me. She works behind the bar downstairs.”	“Oh?” I said. 	“Yeah I sneaked her up here when she was done.”Then Steve never mentioned it again. The guy barely speaking the rest of the morning. Just sitting quiet as we waited in line at the customs. The guy looking at the border signs, then out of the blue, asking as I told what had to be the tenth ‘freelance immigration border agent’ holding a sign to fuck off. 	“Where we going?”	“Laos.”	“Really?”	“Yeah,” I said, “You’ll like it.”	“What the fuck for?”	“Temples – Like I say - You’ll like it - there’s loads there, you can get spiritual. Get your mind off these women.”	“What about ladyboys?”I had to think about that one. In the end, I just said.	“In Lao’s. Couldn’t tell you, but maybe.” I looked at Steve as all he said next was.	“Fuck.” Then he said. “you know I was thinking yesterday when I was relaxing, I had good fun with your girls sister after you got your teeth knocked out and all. Then I got worried and felt all paranoid and guilty about just how much fun I had had. Then I thought what good did it do dad. He would have thought like that. With all the hiding and shit he must have done.”	“So?”	“Well then I got bored waiting for you, so I went down to the bar and next thing I know it’s two am and I got this ladyboy in my bath. And I’m looking at her feeling all guilty again and like then I thought, she’s a hottie, even if she does have big feet. Then I thought, gay guys aren’t interested in pretty girls with makeup and long hair. Gay guys like real men like you. Huge butch fuckers with big boots and tight shorts and shit. Gay guys don’t even like gay guys, they like real men.”	“So what about dad then?” I asked, “What about that little fluffy fuck who come knocking on our door and ruining our Sunday lunch?” It was a good point and one that all of us where still trying to process. Especially mum. This guy who’d come crashing into our world. Banging on the door with his soft hands. Standing there next to our mothers plant pots crying in his white linen suit and stylish shoes. The man more effeminate and gay than any man I’d ever in my life seen before. 	“Maybe he had a snatch?” Steve said in complete seriousness. Then before I could speak he said it again. “Yeah. Maybe he had a vagina hidden away in those fancy pants, like these girls here hide their dicks? Maybe dad wasn’t gay and he was just a kinky fucker like me.”      That’s a stretch, and a big one.Well, if that’s how my brother wanted to deal with it all, so be it. Who was I to judge, we all needed to heal if we ever could, that is. So I said.	“Yeah well you go do what you gotta do, but just don’t get pregnant.”					***************Three hours later we were through what had to be the most complicated customs system I’d ever encountered. Still complaining as we reached the hotel in Vientiane I’d sourced whilst in the middle of the melee of confusing autocratic bullshit, I said.	“I’d rather stick needles in my eyes than go through that again.” both of us quickly realising once we hit the system that we should have hired one of the agents hustling us in the carpark instead of poo pooing them off in the way that we had. “I’ll sell the car and get a plane back I think.”	“I thought you liked this car?” Steve said as we pulled up outside the hotel. The place large and neatly tucked into a thin side road in the centre of the city. It was a good point, I did like the car, but I was on a roll - so I said.	“you bring it then, I’ll fly.”	“Or you could swim back?” Steve said with a grin.Swim, yeah, like those cunts last night, I thought. But little did I know that is exactly what we’d both end up doing. 	Chapter Ten 	    	 	Laos’s capital Vientiane felt different. The city perhaps what a relatively busy capital in Thailand had been like, say thirty years back. With its underdeveloped streets and older cars. The hotel though, seemed nice. Not hot tub in the room nice, not that I’d gotten much use of that whilst we were there anyway. But Vientiane city, yeah, it was different. Not really old, kind of dirty Asian, with a big mix of French culture thrown in.       A back packers paradise which offered little more than bragging rights back home with its cheap accommodation. Where the kids who’d been and slept on the sweaty hostel beds could feel superior with their friends and say shit like ‘Oh well yeah, when we were in Laos.’       The place cooler in temperature and full of tourist traps along with an abundance of temples. The place its own kind of mecca to the similar crowd of westerners who’d looked down upon me in Samui. Most stentorian in their new found synthetic faith. Steve saying as he now sat at the hotel bar sipping a beer. 	“What’s the deal with all the poofters?” The place also offering it seemed a warm welcome to gay couples of both gender orientation. I said. 	“That’s a bold statement – Coming from someone who’s just spent the weekend sucking dick.”Steve, not even batting an eyelash at my words, saying straight back. 	“we’ll see how you fair when your girls pants come down.” But I wasn’t here to debate my brothers new sexual yearnings. I was here to find the one guy in town who’d brokered the deal for those pricks at the Christian Bavarian congregation Group Mission. Or whatever it was that those deceitful cunts called themselves. Not that they were an issue anymore. Their spokesman Han’s telling me that they’d been told by some shithead excuse for a human being the person they needed to talk to was some Tuk Tuk driver who rides about town flying a small green flag. The prick telling me this as snot dripped from his nose whilst he’d trembled and cried. Right before the man had leant back to far and fallen into the drink. 	So that’s who I now was seeking in this dirty little town that called its self a city. And whilst I was here, there would be no sightseeing. No relaxing at the bar. No hotel pool. No spiritual adventures to the temple. Everyone else could get on with doing their thing. But I’d be looking for just one man.	Leaving Steve at the bar with the little fella, I left the hotel and walked the tight narrow road until I reached a main one which didn’t seem a whole lot bigger. The shops, restaurants and bars looking as though they’d seen better days. The streets dirty and full of litter. Sitting along the road was a row of Tuk Tuks. The small little three wheel vehicles with their noisy engines looking like an oversized modern day rikshaw. Their owners sitting there in hope of some foreigner coming their way, to lazy to walk three blocks. 	I moved on to another road, and then another, until I found myself standing on the same side of the river I had been floating on the previous night. The dark water moving peacefully southwards towards the ocean. No sign of any burnt out boat or drowned Christians floating face down amongst the reeds in their matching T-shirts. Then, as I stared out across the water, I wondered again firstly why I was here, when only weeks ago I’d been sitting on my ass watching hockey in Alberta. What would I be doing now if my dumb brother had sat with some other girl the night he’d met this Sherri? Or discovered this new sword swallowing hobby for that matter earlier. I’d be sitting at home with my front teeth intact. Cheering on a bunch of guys who were not so lucky. I’d be still girl less. And the little fella would have been ripped to death by that fucking rabid dog. And that fuck head Mai Thai champion would still be believing he was just that. And those kids last night would have been raped by a bunch of sick fucks pretending to be working in god’s name. So right now, there was no better place to be than standing here in my big fucking boots. Even if I had lost my teeth and had to suffer three hours of frustrating bullshit autocracy trying to cross the border at the friendship bridge.	With no Tuk Tuk flying a little green flag to be seen I headed back to the hotel. Steve still sitting there in the bar. Same spot, but with no dog. Ignoring him I looked around for the little fella. Then I spotted the puppy not far away. The little whippersnapper with his light brown fur sitting on the lap of one of two women who from what I could tell could only be nothing other than a couple. The puppy loving the fuss being given to him by the one women with man’s hands along with his wife who was caressing him with her long slender fingers and sharp red nails. The two women looking to me as I smiled at them with no teeth as though a serial killer had just entered the room. I turned back to Steve, who said. 	“Little fella’s a chick magnet.”Sitting down next to him I said,	“I think you’re both barking up the wrong tree with those two.”Thinking about it, Steve shrugged, 	“Maybe?”The guy was, even I could see that. The women there as much an item as any hetero male and female I’d seen in marriage.	“Good luck with that.” 	“We here long?” Steve then asked.	“Why?” 	“Because Le just called.”Le - the beautiful lovely sister of my new girl. Who apparently liked to fight and fuck, not necessarily in that order. Now chasing Steve. Who’d have thought that would happen when I first saw her as she’d walked around the inside that ring waving to the crowd. The girl looking all innocent, as the western men who weren’t with their wives whistled back. As pretty as she was, the guy needed protecting, needed to be kept away from her or there’d be more trouble in the future. So I said,	“Go then - fuck off back - fly if you want.”	“No I’ll stay here.” Steve replied with out hesitation. “I know you don’t want me to go cos you want me to look after the dog.” 	“I never asked you to babysit.”And I never had, not once. Steve seeming to just like having the little fella around with him whilst I was out doing my thing.	I waited a while. Ate some food, and watched as the two ladies fussed about with the dog until the little fella had had enough of them and made his way back to his dad. Then as the sun set I took him out with me into the dark streets thin streets that wove their way through the small cities centre. The little puppy getting the attention he deserved from the tourists that seemingly kept the city alive. I made it up to the river and passed through a market full of cheap designer knock offs, Then I walked along the river bank and stared down at the empty restaurants that lined the rivers side. So this is what I’d seen at night when I looked from the other side. Emptiness - with a few streets that seemed to be hanging in there. Stopping, I looked around to the road which now ran on the other side of a small park. Cars passing through on both sides. One Tuk Tuk racing through. Then another. It’s back loaded to the brim with westerners. Another with what looked like the guy who owned the vehicles wife and child. Another with a little green flag. So he was here, That prick of a man Han’s, hadn’t been lying. That predator, that disciple of God, that fraudulent emissary with his soft features and tone. The man puking out the truth as he pissed and shit his pants about this green flag flying shithead tuk tuk driver in the vain hope his life could be saved via his admissions. Not that it had helped – or it was ever going to. Now though I’d seen him. This green flag flying prick, and it would only be a matter of time before our paths would cross. 								*************      With my feet aching, I hit the elevator. Putting the little fella down on the floor to walk a bit, I found the hotel room and walked inside. Stopping in my tracks as I saw Steve sitting up in bed with the two ladies from the bar sitting either side of him. He said in a manner as though this was nothing other than the norm. 	“We were wondering when you were getting back, the girls wanted to see the little fella again.”	“Is that right?” I answered in the same casual manner as I looked at the three of them sitting there with the duvet lifted high to cover the girls breasts. 	“Mary and Dan are looking to have a children and I offered to help.”	“Is that right?” I said again with a smile, then asked. “How’s that going?”	“We got off to a good start, could take a while though. You know.” Steve answered. The woman staying silent for the moment. Then the prettier of the two piping in as she said.	“Please don’t get the wrong idea. It can be only Steve, we don’t want any confusion.”	“Yeah,” Steve said, “No confusion - it’s just me - we want the babies to be true sisters and born at the same time, so you know.”	“You know what?” I asked. 	“Well you can get another room.”	“Me?” I said in shock. “What’s wrong with their room, go be the meat in their sandwich there?”	“No, They’re worried I might steal something.” Steve said back with a cheeky grin as he began to laugh. Looking to the two girls as he did. Then turning back to me he said. 	“We had a bet - I told Mary and Dan you had a retard issue going on with your brain and they didn’t believe that you’d say that. I said you couldn’t not. So thanks. I won”	“Won what?” I asked as I tried to remember exactly what insult I’d just blurted out randomly as usual. 	“Sandwich – meat in the sandwich – I guaranteed you’d say it and it took less than a minute. Steve answered, then in a manner that could only mean he wanted me gone, he carried on saying.      “No seriously, we’ve discussed this, their room is a female only space. But feel free to leave the dog so he can watch.” So I did just that. Leaving the little fella there with them, to be pruned and fussed over by the one woman Steve wasn’t fucking at that particular time. 					***************      By the time the sun had risen bringing life to the old brickwork and buildings that sat tight against the hotels small parcel of land, I was sitting alone in the breakfast room with an omelet and toast in front of me. The paintings and photos on the walls depicting the city in its old self which strangely did not vary much it seemed in how the place looked at this precise moment.  	Leaving the hotel I took a walk wondering how much progress my brother Steve was making with his new mission to engage the wombs of the two lovely ladies and repopulated the planet. Whether he’d even thought further than the end of his dick about fatherhood and any child support that he could be liable for should their mission end in success was still to be considered.       Reaching the main drag, I followed the line of monks swathed in their orange robes as they wandered the street with their brass bowls. Each one grateful for the food they would share later. Food placed within by the locals looking to keep on the good side of their god.	There were no lines of Tuk Tuks just yet. All of them knowing no doubt the sweet spot for them to arrive when the driven few had dragged themselves from their hotel beds in effort to see something not a whole lot different from what they’d seen the day before.       So I waited, standing there in my big boots, T shirt and cut of jeans as an hour passed and the morning rush hour began its start. Then the first Tuk Tuk arrived without a little green flag. The driver smiling. His mouth with less teeth than mine as he pointed to the small display of tourist trap venues he could whisk me to at an inflated price he had taped to the side of his vehicle. I asked.	“You speak English?”He did - kind of. 	“sir yes.”	“How much for all day?” The man looking to me for the moment confused. Then he said. 	“long - How?”	“Twenty four hours.” I answered. The man looking to me in shock as he rolled his eyes and evidently wondering what the fuck I was up to. 	“Why?” He asked.	“Why not?” I answered.	“Eleven million kip. And stop food.”Okay, that was fine. Eleven million kip being, about $500 US. I said as I pulled half the money from my pocket.	“I pay for food” I told him then asked, “What’s your name?”	“Kim.”	“Kip for Kim.” I said back. Then handing him the money I left him where he was and walking across the road sat myself on a wall. 	Two hours later I had not moved and neither had Kim. The man going no further than the back of his ride from where he slept in a slumber so deep no tourist wanting to see Buddha park or the temple of Wak Si Saket could ever wake him from. 	Tuk Tuks began to come and go. Parking behind with frequency as I sat there watching the road. Men in nicely ironed lose shorts and shirts with caps and sunglasses with their socks up to their knees. Hoarding bored families with wives who’d prefer to be shopping for cheap clothes and children who’d rather be anywhere but where they were now.	Then I saw him again. This man driving his Tuk Tuk with its little green flag. The three wheeled vehicle pulling out onto the street two roads ahead. The tiny bus sweeping into traffic at speed. Getting up I crossed the road as quick as the vehicles would let me and shaking Kim’s foot woke him. 	“Time to go!” The man saying as he sat up and looked to the traffic around him in surprise. 	“Okay – Okay.”   With one eye on the road I watched the Tuk Tuk with its little green flag moving through traffic some three hundred yards ahead. Kim starting his engine and instantly whipping the small vehicle out into traffic as he did. Kim twisting his head and neck as he drove, looking back. Watching me as much as he was the road. 	“You go where?”	“Straight.”Straight to hell, I’m sure for what I have done, I looked to Kim the man having fun on his big payday. His face beaming as I moved my big frame closer to him. Squashing my ass as I sat back down upon the tiny bench seat. Weaving through the traffic, the Tuk Tuk with the green flag took a quick left. Signalling to Kim to do the same as we hit the turn, we followed. Then did the same as the green flag man took a right, and then another right. Then suddenly as if Kim had worked it all out in his mind, we slowed. Of the fifty odd cars that were ahead of us, the one we were actually following had a green flag. Worried Kimturned once more to me and said. 	“flag… green?”And as soon as the man realised he was correct his face dropped and his demeanor changed. Without another word he shifted his Tuk Tuk to the side of the road. Pulling out the money I had given him and throwing it back at me, he said. 	“Go.”But I wasn’t going anywhere. The man staring at me now in disgust as though I was vermin.	“Go!” he then said again.Then I got it, how could these guys not know who was who and what was going on. I looked to the Tuk Tuk with its little green flag as it drifted further and further into the distance. 	For a moment, Kim sat there looking to me. The man weighing me up in his mind. The flag flying Tuk Tuk we’d been following, now disappearing from sight. He said,	“You want drug?”Not a chance	“No.”This guy Kim now trying to work out in his mind if I was maybe lying. Then he asked another question.	“You here buy drug?”He had it wrong.	“No - no drugs.” I answered slowly. Then he said again.	“Go.”For fuck sake. Reaching down, I pulled out my phone and wrote into it and then translated it to Lao. ‘this man Tuk Tuk green flag hurts children. Green flag man – Bad Man.’ The man looking at my phone still trying to work out my intentions. So I wrote. ‘I hurt Bad man.’ And seeing that, he was then happy. The man saying back. 	“Bad man….. You no buy drugs?”I said back, 	“No buy drugs, no.” The man then saying to me as he shook his head.	“Man green flag sell drug. You buy drug, come police come police – me die.” Pointing to myself, I said,	      “I no buy drug. I hurt bad man.”The man smiling at me showing off his teeth, letting me know how now I’m sure other people saw me.   	We carried on along the road, Kim now driving with a new vigour. The Tuk Tuk with its little green flag disappearing again, for now. Half an hour later we were back in the centre of town. Close to the river. Both of us with no front teeth sitting on a corner table outside a café watching the traffic flow by. Kim stuffing a pastry down his throat as he drank his coffee. The man pointing to himself saying, 	“army – me - yes”I looked at him, the man easily in his early fifties with his weathered skin and calloused hands. 	“When?” I answered back.	“Vewy strong.” He said with a smile, as the flakes of pastry fell from his lips.I’m sure he was strong. Since he had no front teeth I had another question which was concerning me. So picking up my phone I translated, 	“How do you eat an apple?” And reading it and smiling with no teeth to show the man simply reached into his pocket and pulling out a flick knife he hit the switch and opened it for me. So that was it. Cut and chew.I looked about, Laos ladies passing us young and old. Beautiful women, clothed in traditional dress of long wrapped exquisitely woven silk skirts all patterned in soft tones. My eyes then following a gay couple as they passed, and wondered how Steve was getting on with his latest venture and whether he’d walked the little fella. Kim the Tuk Tuk driver watching me, then saying. 	“like men you men yes.”It was a funny question, I didn’t, not in the way he was inferring. Then he said.	“Show me phone.” So I did. From what I could tell, he wanted to see the translation I had shown him again. So I showed it, the man reading the words again slowly. Then he took a sip from his coffee and looking me in the eye said.	“think drugs - not know this about children. True?”From what the soft skin German Christian man had told me about how this certain Tuk Tuk driver had taken payment for his services in arranging the party boat cruise. So the answer was in my eyes a big yes. And from what I’d seen just the night prior, business was booming. I said. 	“yes. but I stop it.”The man looking at me and my cut off shorts and my big boots.	“Police, you?”I shook my head, as Kim’s eyes stayed on me. The man now even more curious than he had been before. I wrote bad man again into my phone and hit translate. Kim looking at the screen and getting it said.	“Bad man?” 	“Who me?” I asked pointing to myself.	“No – flag green– bad man.”The man nodding to himself as he said the words over and over again, giving off the sense that he was in nothing more than disgust. 	An hour later we were off and out again roaming the tight noisy streets. The Tuk Tuk’s engine playing havoc with my ears. My ass sore from the wooden bench. Kim now the scout and I the hunter. Both of us scanning road after road, back and forth as we drove and waited. Eating, then driving again in what felt like one hour cycles. Kim asking me over and over each time we stopped about the murky business of the man we both now looked for. The man becoming more and more frustrated as the day went on.   	Then, at last, as the sun was beginning to set, I saw him for the third time as we slowly cruised through a boulevard.The man passing us at speed with his little green flag flying. Kim turning his head to me in excitement saying,       “Bad man – Bad Man - Bad man.” From what I could tell now that I could see him closer, this man who flew a green flag was somewhere in his forties. The man looking smooth with his nice new clean clothes and long hair. The two of us following as he took in the tourist circuit winding around and around it one block at a time. Kim saying “Bad Man” over and over as we went. The green flag man out looking for tourists even though it was late afternoon rush hour and the tourist sites were closing. 	We waited, following. Letting him drift into the distance and picking him up after he’d turned. Myself now singing quietly a certain super hero movie theme in the hope that Kim would say the two words of English he’d just learned at its end. Then as though we were ourselves writing the score to our own little franchised picture, the stars aligned and with the timing just perfect , I said out loud,       “na, na… na, na… na, na… na, na… na, na”  to which Kim unconsciously spat out at the end,      “Bad mannn!”Bored with it all after reaching nirvana in the sense of movie score gold, I told Kim to stop and got out. The Tuk Tuk driver smiling at me with no teeth as I stretched. I knew from following and watching his habits that the Tuk Tuk we’d been following would be coming around the block again soon enough. Both of us knowing as Kim nodded to me and pulled away that I would now wait and give the green flag man exactly what he was looking for and hail him over the next time round.   					***************         I waited on a corner. The Tuk Tuk with its green flag taking its time to show, and as it did I raised my hand and pulled it over to the side of the dusty road. 	“Where do you go?” The man asking with a lot more confidence in English than Kim. Myself saying as I sat down in the back. Feeling the soreness in my ass cheeks as I did.    	“Just drive.” I said, as the man pulled away. The man looking back at me in his mirror as he drove, asking again. 	“Where you go?” whilst he played with his phone, before tucking it back into his pocket. 	“River.” I replied, “Show me the river.” The Tuk Tuk driver nodding, taking a right and then another until we’d turned into the busy street that ran along the waters edge. Then I sat there in the back. Waiting and knowing that soon the traffic would stop us in its tracks. I looked forward along the road I was now so familiar with. The Tuk Tuk coming to a slow and then a stop. Myself knowing this would not be changing soon. So I said as the Tuk Tuk driver rode his clutch and inched his way along the road, the same words that the Christian spokesman had told me would give me access into this man’s disease ridden world.    	“I’m here to see the golden needle.” And hearing it the man turned his head and looked back at me for a moment. Taking his time, he took in my build, my teeth, my cut down shorts and big boots. Then looking all around him to the traffic and beyond, he said. 	“You from where?”	“Canada,” I replied. The man nodding then saying. 	“Canada yes, United state of America, yes?”No, but there was one person who’d love that…	“Never” I answered. Then he said. 	“Problem, now, maybe next week.”Maybe next week. That wasn’t good. He said.	“Big problem, next week come back.”Taking out a huge sum of money I held it out to him. Then said. 	“Okay for you.”The man reaching out to take the large amount of money in a practiced way that seemed to come alarmingly too easy. Then as he twisted his body and reached out his hand I caught it and had him in an arm lock before he knew what had happened. With my free hand I then pulled his phone from his pocket and holding it to him, said.	“Open your phone.” The man struggling as he panicked. Kicking out with his feet as he unconsciously pulled back on the throttle, screaming the engine. The man’s eyes staring back at me as he felt his arm about to break. Bringing up his phone I twisted his wrist in a way his fingers would open,       “give me the code or I’ll break your arm.” Then said it again,	“Tell me…..” But as soon as the words left my lips, Kim appeared. The man’s eyes now made of pure madness. The Lao Tuk Tuk driver Kim whom having spent the day with myself had quickly become my friend. Kim pulling the same knife he apparently used to eat apples, quickly flicking it open and stabbing the Tuk Tuk driver with the green flag four times in the chest in quick succession, saying with every thrust,	Bad man, bad man, bad man, bad man.”  Then with a brief knowing look to myself, Kim was gone. Disappearing into the crowd. With his hand still held tight on the throttle and the engine screaming at full revs, the life began to drain from the green flag flying man’s body. The muscles in his left leg becoming weaker as his left foot slipped off the clutch. With the handlebars twisted, pulled into the right, the screaming engine engaged sending the Tuk Tuk shunting itself straight into a the front of a Mazda heading the other direction in the opposite lane. The Tuk Tuk colliding hard with the Mazda as they both stopped in their tracks, sending the Tuk Tuk driver with his sore wrist and four stab wounds in his chest and myself out of our seats and onto the road.	Quickly, I picked myself up and looked to the driver to see that he was dead. Then I looked to the man’s phone still in my hand and with out a second thought bent down and placed his fingers of his right hand on the screen until it opened. And as soon as I saw the phone was now in my control, I was gone. 					**************      I moved off into the crowd, neither running nor walking, just moving, as I passed along the vehicles all waiting in the stationary traffic. Kim the Tuk Tuk driver now nowhere to be seen. Spotting a police man in a café as he now stood. The noise of the collision ruining the coffee he’d been sipping for free. The man looking to me walking away from an accident that was taking up everyone else’s attention.      Maybe fifty people had seen me there, even if they did not exactly know what had actually happened. There had been a large western guy in big boots and cut of shorts who’d been in the Tuk Tuk when it had crashed into the on coming vehicle. And if the policeman decided to put down his iced latte and go talk to them, he could easily put two and two together and come back with myself as the answer.       That fucking Kim guy getting handy with his knife. I looked down at the phone of the shit head who’d just been killed. It’s instructions all written in Lao. Quickly changing the settings to English I then removed the passcode security feature and popped the phone on my pocket.  What I needed to do was get myself out of dodge and do it quickly. I passed through the market and out onto the pathway that stretched itself along the river. Then looking to Thailand on the other side as I walked, I looked back to see the same police man following me. I now had a problem. I kept on moving northward along the tow path. The river to my left hand side flowing with force and purpose. The overhanging trees with their bright leaves hanging above my head. The cop in his light green uniform watching as he followed from behind at a distance.Fuck this is all I need now, With a casual air I found the best spot to run and hit the river if I needed to and sat myself down upon a bench. In front of me was a stone wall built strong enough and high enough to keep a rising river at full flow from breaking its bank. Its stonework dropping deep down to a slope now covered in reeds on the riverside that ran to the water. Reeds which soon enough would be ripped up and taken by the monsoon rains when they came. The wall on the city side just tall enough not to obscure the view. A quiet place for lovers on an evening stroll or fuckers like me to have hidden had this cop just sat back down and finished his latte. But here we were. Myself on a bench waiting. Watching some cop out of the corner of my eye. If I was lucky the man would just get bored and fuck off. I waited, sitting, as I minded my own business and watched the bloody sun in its setting light on the other side of the river. The cop still there. The man either waiting for back up or the courage to just walk down under the overhanging trees and speak to me. Maybe it was a language thing. Maybe he was listening to his radio. Maybe he was looking to go it alone and find a way to scam a bribe. From the looks of it from what I could tell, it was the latter. Then just as a crowd of teenagers passed through, the man made up his mind.       The police man walking behind them as he tried his best to blend in. The man reaching me as I sat on the bench and stopping as the kids carried on. The man standing before me with his hand resting on the government issued pistol he carried on his hip. He said,	“Accident. - you accident.” Then picking up his radio and showing it to me he carried on saying.       “Accident - You run.”      Run? I didn’t run, what the fuck was he talking about? I looked back at the guy. My face one of complete bewilderment. I then looked to the river behind where he now stood. Then along the path which was now clear in both directions. I figured that if I stood and moved in close enough I could have him in a Port Alberni in a matter of seconds which would keep his arms away from the pistol whilst I choked him out. So that’s what I’d do. 	Standing slowly, I held out my hands as though I had no idea as to what the man meant. Saying as I went,	“No English, no English.”Then the moment the man took his eye from me I was on him. Tucking my arms under his so as he could not reach his weapon, I swept his legs from under him and by the time we’d both reached the floor the man was struggling to breathe in a headlock with his gun arm incapacitated and his feet kicking. Smelling the man’s sweat and the grease from his hair I counted until at twelve he went still.  	With a quick look along the pathway in both directions, I then pulled the man to the wall and lifting him up I carefully dropped him down the high side of the wall feet first into the reeds on the other side. Jumping over, I dropped myself down feeling the mud stones left over from the monsoon rains squish beneath my boots and the and vegetation crumble as my weight hit home.       I crouched down next to the man, his face lit by the setting sun which now stretched itself bare upon the wall behind him. Reaching down I unclipped his pistol and placed it under a rock out of sight. Then I pulled his belt from his waist and the laces from his big brilliantly shined police issue boots. Lifting his knees up to his chin, I tied his feet to his hands.       A few seconds later the police man came around. The man for a moment dazed and not understanding where he was. Then as soon as he tried to stand and felt his feet and hands bound he realized he was in trouble. The first thing he did as he struggled was shout in a language I could not comprehend. Then as he watched me not give a care for his cries for help he looked around, quickly realising the large stone wall rising up behind him and the constant rush of the river would drown any screams he wished to share with the world. Giving up he then said in English as he looked up into my eyes, his voice trembling in fear.  	“not kill me… Children.” And heard myself saying back in a soft voice. 	“You speak English?” the man nodding his reply, as he heard me say,	“I love your boots.” The man’s eyes darting in panic, from one side to the other as he did his best to look back at me. 	“Don’t worry you’re fine.”The man was fine. If you call being trussed up like a turkey on the wrong side of a riverbank wall fine. But he was. I had no beef with this man, he was only doing his job after all. The policeman staring at me in complete fear as he gazed at my missing teeth, saying again.	“Not kill me… Children.”  Myself saying back calmly. 	“Stay quiet – I let you go - Understand.” Then I held up a rock big enough to chew and pushed it between his lips and said. 	“Make noise – this go here – okay?– no teeth like me!”Then displaying my missing teeth I held the rock in front of his face for him to see. Pulling his shirt away from his neck at his collar, I dropped the rock down the inside of his shirt so as he could feel it’s size and weight pressed against at his chest. Putting my finger to my lips I waited, staring into his eyes as I did.       Getting it, but still terrified, the police man stared back. His forehead sweating heavily in the sun despite the cool river air. I said.	“Tuk Tuk man in accident, he hurt children – stay quiet - I let you go - I not hurt you.” The police man sitting there breathing heavy as he looked into my eyes in dread. Then I said, “stay quiet and still until dark and you will be fine.”                  				*************      	The sun was down by the time I’d gotten Steve on the phone and the sirens covering the road accident a good mile behind me had soothed. Climbing back over the wall I sat myself down on a bench and in complete frustration as he eventually answered, I asked.	“What you doing?”	“Nothing.” He replied, but I could tell something was going on. 	“I’ve been to the temple, guy threw water on me and gave me a band on my wrist. Same as you got, so I’m Buddhist just like you now.”God help them.	      “What about the little fella.”	“No he’s still agnostic – I asked if they had one of them wrist bands for him but they don’t bless dogs there.”	“He good?” I asked ignoring the kids stupid bullshit.	“Girls love him. Want to take him back to Hamburg. I said ‘you can take my tadpoles but the dog stays here’.”Fuck me,I got on with it and quickly said. 	“Remember when we used to go down the river back home and the water was freezing.”	“Yeah.”	“Well, this time it’s not going to be cold.”	“Who’d you kill now?” Steve then asked.	“No one.”      “Well if that’s the case then I’m busy.”	“Stop fucking about and do as I say.” I said, taking charge. “Check out the hotel now but say you are leaving in the morning. Then take the little fella with you and go buy four life jackets.”	“From where exactly?”	“If you can talk yourself into bed with two fucking lesbians, you can find a shopping centre. Get the life jackets and some water and some chocolate bars and don’t forget something for the puppy.”	“Seriously - what the fuck have you done now?” Steve asked again now concerned, as I heard him move himself into the bathroom close the door and start to take a piss.	“Nothing.”	“Sounds familiar - I doubt that.” I heard him say back. Then I said, 	“I’m down by the river. Park the car in one of the side streets next to the Starbucks café. Then walk to the tow path, then take a right. Start walking under the trees and I’ll see you. But don’t hang about as it’ll get quiet soon and I don’t need that.”       But Steve being Steve, did take his time, and it did start to get quiet. The place being busy for the best part of the evening as young couples strolled along hand in hand as they looked out to the lights on the other side of the Mekong.       I was taking the chance that the green flag guy was either lying on a slab in the morgue or in a hospital bed somewhere in the city. If I was lucky no one would have worked out yet that the wounds to his chest were from a knife instead of maybe something pointy on the handlebars that had injured him during the crash. There was also a chance that someone in the street or the car behind had seen me talking to the guy and then that other crazy fuck Kim run up and stab him.       But apart from the guy who’d followed me who’d found himself trussed up like a chicken on the other side of the wall, I couldn’t see or hear any other police activity. So maybe not.       One thing was for sure. There was no chance now after messing this cop up like I had, that I could just get Steve to pick me up and we could leave the country via that irritating border post we came in on, or say Vietnam. If we did and we got nabbed there, I’d feel like a right plum for not just having just jumped into the river and fucked off right now as I intended.         I tried Steve again. It was now nearly eleven and he wasn’t answering his phone. Then just as I was about to check on the cop once more, I saw them. These guys, all in their late teens or early twenties. Walking slowly onto the seawall from afar. Passing me once, then twice. The group of five stopping further along and leaning against the river banks wall as they chatted and walked back and forth giving furtive looks towards me. The guys no strangers to trouble and out to cause some. Me sitting there in the dim light. An easy victim. A foreign guy to boot. As nice as the Laos people were there was always the odd one, or five as it turned out. They waited as I waited. The young men turning their backs to anyone who passed now with increasing infrequency as the evening wore on. The group wondering why I wasn’t moving despite their presence and obvious intentions. The guys slowly making their way towards me as midnight came and the curfew started. 	Just as they reached me, I stood. The boys keeping their distance as they surrounded me. Myself not believing the shitty luck I’d been having since I’d hailed down the man who flew a green flag. I told them in a manner they’d understand which ever language they spoke. 	“Fuck off or I’ll hurt you.”The kids closer now standing there and by the looks of their well-worn clothes and flip flops understanding my words or not, they did they did not seem to care.       Then they laughed as they saw the state of my teeth and whilst they did the kid who seemed to be in charge pulled a flick knife not to dissimilar to Kim’s. The boy standing there, holding the knifes shaft in his right hand as he pointed it towards the floor. With a quick push with his thumb on the knifes switch the six inch double sided blade shot out from the knifes top. Things were definitely about to get tricky. The guy holding the knife that to him must have felt like a sword, saying as the others looked about ironically in case the cops were near.	      “I from Vientiane,” Myself laughing quietly at the boy as I stood there watching him posture. He said it again. 	“Vientiane,” And this was supposed to mean something to me?	“Calgary.” I said, answering back, as I pointed to my chest. Then I heard him say this time as he stared at the phone I’d just stolen.	“Phooone.” With a smile that showed my missing teeth and without the slightest hint of fear. Taunting him with his own words, I said back.	“No…. phooone….” Then I said it again as I took a step towards him and tucked the stolen phone into my pocket. 	“Nooooo….. phoooone…”The other boys laughing at my mockery of their leading man as he tried to show his strength. Then the moment he took his eyes from me for the slightest of a second to show them his displeasure, I gave him something that he would never forget for the rest of his life. Spinning my body around with a kick that was not to dissimilar to the one that removed my front teeth. I felt the grit grate beneath the sole of my boot upon the pathway as I turned and put my right boot straight into the kids chest. Sending him flying across the towpath and into the brick built wall. The other kids staring in disbelief as I walked over and with a twist of the kids wrist I pulled the knife from his hand and placed it in my pocket. The kid looking up at me dazed as I turned to his friends, smiling at them with no teeth, as I said. 	“Next?”But if they didn’t understand, I’m pretty sure they got the gist. Walking back to the bench I sat myself back down and looked up at the kids as they now stood there with their leader lying on his back with no wind left in his lungs. And then as the kids dispersed leaving their fallen leader to his own devices, out of nowhere Steve arrived carrying a big pack on his back and the little fella in his arms. Looking to the rucksack on his back. I asked.	“What you got in there for fuck sake?”	“Clothes and shit. Can’t believe how cheap they are – Had to get em all sealed up.”For fuck sake, that’s why he took so long.      “I’m here fighting a gang of street kids and you’re fucking ironing.” I said as he looked to the kid laying on the floor. He asked.	“Who’s this?”	“He’s from Vientiane.”Steve stood there staring at the kid as he lay there with his mouth wide open still trying to breathe.	“What’s wrong with him?”      “He hit his head on the wall.”	“Can’t you go anywhere without causing trouble?”And he wasn’t half wrong I suppose. It would have helped if he’d have got a move on though. So I said,	“Try not taking six hours to go to the store.”Steve looked to his watch, then back to the kid on the floor as he tried to get up. Then back to me. 	“Try not causing shit everywhere you go.”	“Try not giving whores seventy grand.”	  				******************      Climbing the wall we dropped ourselves down to the water’s edge and sat in the darkness on the river bank. With the rucksack between his knees Steve began to empty its contents. Looking out across the black water to the other side of the river, he said.	“Can’t we just take a taxi?”	“Where’s the fun in that?” I asked him as I looked at some of his shirts neatly piled up and sealed in a clear plastic container, then I asked.	“You get any zip lock bags?”Reaching in, Steve pulled a small packet of them and dropped them at my feet. 	“Lucky one of us got a brain.” He said as he looked again at the river. His eyes following some debris as it quickly passed by. Then he said. 	“What if we drown?”	‘Then we get to apologize to dad,”	“For what?”	“Being cunts.”      And as my words triggered something deep within Steve’s mind. Some personal memory revivified from either the day our father died or perhaps something that he’d wished he’d said or done before this great man had left us. I watched as he sat his ass down in the wetness of the mud on the bank and stared into nowhere. 	Pulling the flick knife from my pocket, I hit the switch and watched as the blade automatically appeared faster than the eye could see. The double sided knifes sharp steel edge shining in the moon light. Then flying back in again, disappearing from sight as though it had never been there at all. Hitting the switch the blade popped back out. The snap of the knifes springs and lock mechanism breaking Steve away from whatever dark thoughts had taken a hold of him. He said,	“What the fuck you doing with that?”	“I need it for eating apples.” I answered as I retracted the blade and picked up a piece of wood. Holding it in one hand and placing the knife against it, I hit the switch. The knife instantly popping out, but losing its force and motion as soon as the blade touched the wood. 	“Must be to stop you chopping your balls off.” I said as I looked to the police man sitting with his back against the wall staring back at us both. Then I looked to Steve still in his own little world and wondered if he’d was ever going to notice him at all. Not that it would matter if he did. Nonetheless the boy was hurting bad inside. Walking over to my brother and sitting myself down next to him. I put my arm around the young man and pulled him into me. Then I said knowing I’d need to be careful with my words. 	“he’s gone Steve. Dad’s gone. There’s nothing we can do, you just have to accept that he’s sucking cock in heaven now.”Fuck! Why did I keep coming out with this shit? I thought, as I saw Steve look at me out of the corner of his eye. Then we sat there for what seemed like a while as the water passed by. The lights from Thailand streaming back across the rivers rippling surface. The little fella between my feet. The cop sitting there in the shadows, terrified that I was going to kill him. Then Steve said as he stood and looked at the water. 	“Two things bothering me - Dad, yeah. The other is that you keep hurting people. And you know, one other thing – for someone who’s pissed about me being supposedly late - I don’t see much urgency?”      And he wasn’t wrong. As for some reason I just wasn’t worried and at peace. Obviously the fact that we were in one of the poorest countries in the world helped. One that did not have, I’m sure the most well-funded and trained police force with CCTV cameras coming out the ying yang. I said, as I sat there flicking the blade of my new knife as I played with its switch, 	“Yeah, I like it here I’ve met some good people - made some good friends.” Then he turned, and saw for the first time the trussed up police officer sitting in the darkness against the wall. In panic he turned back to me. His face as serious as it had ever been, and said,	“You got a cop tied up? You are completely fucked in the head.” 	“He was already there when I got here.” I said with a smile. 	“Of course he was.” Steve said straight back knowing I never confessed to anything.He pulled his phone and both our passports from his pocket and now in a hurry placed them in a zip lock bag along with his credit cards and sealed it all. Then he put that bag into another and did the same thing over another two times. Watching him I said, 	“You got the keys to the car?”He did. Taking them from him, I then pulled out all of the cash I had and popped it into a separate bag along with the keys to the SUV.	Reaching down I grabbed a life jacket and put it on, pulling the puffed out nylon fabric full of foam onto my body and fastened it at my waist and under my crutch. Leaving the top loose enough for the puppy to fit. Picking him up I tied a thin rope around his body and tied it to my life jacket.       Putting him inside I stroked the little fella’s head as he sat there tucked under my chin.	“What about him?” Asked Steve as he nodded towards the police man and tied his life jacket tight to his own body in a well-practiced manner.	Slipping in my big boots as I went, I walked back up the bank towards the cop and pulled the man’s gun from under the stone where I’d left it. Then I walked over and stood in front of him. The man sitting there petrified. Tears ran in his eyes and his legs were now shaking uncontrollably. I knelt down in front of him to speak and putting my hand upon my heart I said softly.	“I know this looks bad with that guy in the tuk tuk getting stabbed – and the ones last night who drowned in the river here, but I’d never do anything bad to anyone in front of the puppy.” As the police man stared back at me, dropping his frightened gaze down to my chest he looked to the little fella for a moment as the puppy stared back at him. Dropping the bag full of money along with the car keys at his feet, I pulled out my new knife, flicked it open and heard the man cry inwardly as I reached towards him, cutting the man’s laces away from his hands and undid his belt. Then I said as I pointed away from the river towards the road.	“Go get yourself an S.U.V – it’s all yours - for you – understand?” The man nodding as the words hit home. “It’s parked up there somewhere close to that café you were in.” Then emptying the man’s gun of bullets and throwing them into the reeds I handed him back his gun and said. 	“that Tuk Tuk man hurts children. Look into his life – same with the German fucks you’ll have found floating down stream. Go put the puzzle together and come back a hero.” Then I left the man to sit there in shock. I walked back down to the river and quickly tied the two other life jackets together and with a knot that could never loosen biting into the top of my left arm and Steve’s right arm we then tied ourselves together leaving about three foot slack in between.       Placing a still full rucksack on Steve’s back, we both stepped into the water. The river colder now than I had remembered it being before when it had lapped at my feet on the paddle board. The current instantly dragging at my legs in an effort to pull me into its drift. Then I looked up and saw the police man was now gone. Then to Steve as he stood looking to where the man had been sitting and then to me.	Saying nothing, we carried on walking into the river. Feeling the uneven rocks beneath my big boots. The water now smashing into my ass. As it reached our chests we both on cue lifted our feet and dropped in, surrendering ourselves to the mighty Mekong. Chapter Eleven                   The current swept us away. My feet hanging below me as it twisted our bodies. Spinning the pair of us around in circles as it quickly took us out of our depth. The chance of any issues with the police now, long gone. I knew that. Even if the poor man had gone running to the road and screamed into his radio for help. It made no difference. The river was moving too fast. They’d need a speedy rubber boat that could beat the current to catch us, and they’d need to locate us, which out here in the water, was near on impossible.       I thought back to the Christians and wondered how they would have fared. All of them taking themselves through a second baptism of sorts. Throwing themselves at the mercy of the river for their sins. I’m sure the answer would have to be not well. Not with the way I could feel the current trying to pull me to the river bed below. But what about the husband? Where the fuck had that prick gotten to? Would he have been stupid enough to have thrown himself into the river obviously knowing it’s real strength as well as we both did now? Steve looking to me, feeling the current too, as the rope between us tugged. Saying,	“Fuck, feel that under tow?” I did that was certain. Then he said.	“How’s the little fella.”I looked down, the little fella there clinging to me with his little legs and paws. His wet body shaking as he stretched his neck out towards my face. 	“Bet he’s wishing he’s stayed at that temple eh?”Maybe? I looked at the little puppies eyes bulging out of his head as they stared into mine. So I said. 	“It’ll make him tough. Same as us when we were pups.”And I wasn’t wrong there. How old had we been when we’d first had our asses frozen riding the Bow river. Feeling the currents there whip us around and around, pulling us in its rip. 	Turning my body so as I was facing the bank I silently signalled Steve to do the same as I kicked with my feet pushing us out further into the rivers centre as we went. Then I saw it in the distance. The party boat sitting at anchor in the moonlight. A ghost ship. Now with only its steel hull intact. The structure above, broken up and wrecked by a scorching blaze which had left it charred and hanging in pieces. Good riddance.       We passed it by. Steve staring in awe as though he’d just seen the Mary Celeste itself. My brother asking as water splashed at us both.      “You do that?”      “No.” I answered, and I hadn’t. The Christians had and that green flag cunt and his mates who should have been using the boat as it was intended and not as some sort of child rape factory. Play with fire, get burnt as they say.      “Same as you didn’t tie that cop up. Tell me - you never did this, then why your boots soaked when you got back to the hotel room then?” Steve carried on asking.      It was a good question and one I really didn’t have an answer too. So I just said.      “Just put out some trash that’s all.”        We kept kicking, pushing ourselves across the river as the current pulled us along. Kicking - then taking a breather as we both clutched the spare life jackets which floated along next to us. The beach where I’d smashed the other small boat into the shallow rocks in the distance as we passed by. The boat now long gone.       Then as we passed under the lights and authoritarian guard of the friendship bridge, the lights from the city grew less and it became dark again. Real dark. Until all I could see was the moon in the water and it’s glint in Steve’s eyes as I felt the little fella’s body shaking upon my chest letting me know he was still okay.       In what seemed like hours, but was probably a lot less, we kicked and pulled ourselves across this trench cut into the earth by the Mekong’s mighty force towards the opposite shoreline until we found ourselves back on the Thai side and looking for a place to beach.       Where we were I did not know.             Issan maybe, That place I’d had so many tell me the ‘girls’ came from. Farm girls, and boys who become ‘girls’. Sick of farming for rice and their shitty lives, enticed by friends like sirens with their tales of parties and cash like they’d never seen.         But then as the river quickened as its sides narrowed and we approached and passed a small island made of sand we started to kick hard, pulling at the water as we went until we saw a beach lit by the moon on the rivers side and then felt the rivers bed as our feet dug themselves into its sand.       Pulling ourselves out and still attached by the rope, we lay together on the sand in the moonlight and listened to the water as it rushed by. Steve saying after a moment.      “Where the fuck are we, we back in Thailand?”      “Yeah, Issan - I think.” I replied, not really knowing. “you’ll like it here, full of guys just like you who married bar girls. It’s probably where you’d have ended up. Had she not fucked off and left you for that loser.” But we were nowhere near Issan at all. As we had only gotten as far as Nong Loeng.       I sat up and pulled the little fella from the inside of my lifejacket and untied him. The puppy excited to have its paws now firmly planted into the sand. The little fella, running in circles in front of me before moving over to check on Steve. Steve laying there resting his head on the beach, looking up at the stars as the mosquitos attracted by our breath slowly honed in. He said,       “All that and we never found that prick of a husband.”But I had found him. He’d got away, yes I knew that. However if he did manage to survive the river. I now had his phone number. 	      ****************            We waited on the beach for the sun to rise. The three of us lying on the sand resting. Drinking the small amount of water and food that Steve had been bothered to bring. And then the sun rose. It’s majestic rays spreading heat with a warmth that filled the earth all around us. The sky to the east full of wonderment, the clouds painted deep orange by its rays. Looking to it Steve said.       “I’ve been thinking about that cop.”      “What about him?”      “Well what if he went crying to his friends then they’ll be looking for us down river.”      “Different country.”      “So?”      “with the money they make, you think he’s going to give up all that cash and a car?”Steve thought about that one, then said.	“How much you give him?”	“Everything. Felt guilty, guy was just doing his job.”      Then I looked to Steve, as his thoughts whirled around in his head. The next question forming in his mind would be if the man was such a good sport then why the hell I’d had to tie the guy up in the first place, but instead he surprised me by asking. 	“How much is everything?”	“Couple grand probably.”	“Wow, good for him. He can get some new underpants way he was looking at you. So how much we got now?” 	“How much you got?” I asked back.	“Nothing.” Steve answered as he took one of the life jackets in his hand and let it go. “I spent it on all this shit.” I said. “And shirts.” “Shirts were cheap as chips, so they don’t count.” But it did count, if we had no money now, it did count. But what was the point of getting into that now? So I said. 	“You stupid cunt.”The man looking to me as he stood in disbelief, saying as he looked down at me.	“Go back and talk to that cop, he’ll be opening a clothing store. With what you give.” 	“Well nothings what we got then.” I said as I stood. So we had zero, bar the credit cards and the clothes on my back and the clothes in Steve’s ruck sack on his back. Remembering the flick knife the kid had gifted me the night before I dug my hands into the pockets of my cut off jeans. The knife now gone. Taken somehow by the river. Shit, easy come easy go. I said, to Steve as he stared at me. 	“Knifes gone.”	“Good. Save you killing anyone with it.” Here we go again with that you’re a killer shit.I wondered whether I’d have used it on those perverted fucks on the boat had I have had it then. Probably.	      “Could have kept some cash back so we could get some food and shit.” Steve said, not letting it go as we found our way from the rivers beach and headed south along a gravel road that followed the river. 	“From where?” I asked as I looked to the unused road built from grit and debris which lay in front of us and showed not one inkling of human existence. 	An hour passed before we saw any sign of life. One truck rallying forward. Spraying a cloud of dust in its wake. The vehicle slowing as it neared on the tight gravel road and then failing to stop accelerated again and raced hard towards us. Forcing us to the side. Spraying gravel and fumes into the air as it passed. The three of us expecting exactly the same as another approached, surprising us all when it stopped. The three of us jumping into the back and sitting there as we bounced our way along. Feeling the steel bed of the pickup in our asses and lower backs as we crashed from one pot hole to another. Steve looking at me with every hit as I tried my best to stop the dog from flying over the side.					      **************** 	An hour later we arrived in Buengkan. The three of us sitting in the small riverside towns one café. Myself now with over a hundred thousand baht sitting in my pocket courtesy of the four credit cards I’d just murdered the ATM machine with at the local 7-11. Steve sitting there uncomfortable as he looked out at the road and the river beyond. The man saying,	“We could have just floated down here and saved my ass getting pounded.”  Don’t go there…. But, of course then said,       “I thought that was your thing?” Steve tired and irritable from the river and no sleep, saying straight back almost to himself. 	“Yeah keep it up with the stupid comments as usual.” Then ignoring me, Steve looked to the pretty girls in their uniforms smiling as they discretely watched us and the puppy from behind the counter. The three of us sitting there, dried off now but stinking of the river. We finished our food and drink and finding what had to be the only cab in town, I said to the driver.      “Train station – you go train station?” And that’s where we headed. 					**************** It was a long wait as we sat on the platform. Steve and I both hogging the one wall fan that swung it’s head from side to side. The platform long and dirty with concrete benches where Thai men and women stretched out and slept unembarrassed without a care. Steve saying to me as he watched the comings and goings of the local Thai’s.	“Thought you said this place was full of white guys? We the only ones I seen.”It would have been, had we exited the river in Issan, but we had not, I’d discovered.	“We’re not in that spot, but you’re better off here. There’s no competition with the ladies.”	“Oh?” Said Steve as he looked along the train station. “Well, wake me up when they get here.”      Two hours later we were still there. The ticket girl saying in her best English that we’d have to wait the same two hours for the train and it already felt like three. Steve saying as he sat there folding the clothes he’d had on earlier having just washed himself and the clothes out in the stations shitter. Myself being me, still in my shorts and T shirt. The little fella it seemed, just happy to be alive. Looking at him, Steve said. 	“I don’t get it, I’m here bored as fuck and that dog doesn’t give a shit where we are. Doesn’t even know we’re waiting for a train.”  	“How would he, he’s a puppy. You think you knew you were going on a train when you were four months?” I replied.	“Just saying.”	“Logic.” I said, “Same thing you use when you’re playing with all these girls.” Or whatever he was into these days. The way he’d always found it so easy to mix it up with the ladies. Which was for me, until now, something of an enigma that I could not always understand. Especially with the two in Vientiane. I asked.	“How you end up with those last two women anyway?”Steve smiling at me as he heard the question. 	“Dog - they’d been to the temple and some monk must have told them they would meet a guy with a puppy and he would father their children.”I doubted that very much. 	“you got a monk as your wing man now ?” I asked.	“Well, that and a bit of trickery on my part too, of course. I told them that Buddha had spoken and they were the chosen ones. Told them I see them at the temple when I was there with the dog.”	“So you did go then?” 	“No - Apart from the shopping mall, me and the little fella didn’t get further than the bar. Except when he wanted a shit that is.”       I thought about that one. Steve there in the bar with the puppy lapping up the attention. Me out there on my own personal crusade, looking for some flag flying fuckhead. Then I heard Steve say. 	“Been a funny few days, one minute I’m fucking a guy who looks like a girl…. next minute, I’m fucking a girl who looks like a guy…..then later I’m fucking a girl who looks like a girl, but she doesn’t like dick - I tell you, it’s getting confusing.”      I stared at him for a bit, taking all that in. Then said.	“You saying, the pretty one, wasn’t into it?” Steve shaking his head, saying back. 	“No she hated it. The one that looked like a guy – well let me tell you now that was a surprise. She was a whole different story. Couldn’t get enough. She’d get hold of me and put it in her wife, say shit to her missus like…. ‘stek it in zie muski if ya vant de kinder’.”Fuck me. Then I thought about it some more for a bit. In this new world we now lived in - I had to ask. 	      “So what would you call that then? You got a lesbian woman who identifies as a man, who likes to have sex on the side with men. What pronoun we got there then, Bi?”	“No queer I think,”	“now I’m confused.”	“Welcome to my world.” Steve then said straight back as he rolled his eyes. “But keep this all to yourself right as they told me it a secret. Didn’t want it getting out there in their community that they been fucking a guy, specially the one wearing the trousers. Even if she did like it. Said, if they got pregnant they’d say it was artificial insemination or something like that when the little Stevie’s arrive. That or they’d get religious, pull a Mary, call it immaculate conception. But I think they given up on that Christian shit as they seem to be listening to the monks these days. Which is how - like I say - I become involved in the first place.”	“Luckily for you.”	“Yeah, lucky or unlucky depends how much you like eating fish.” Steve said back with a grin on his face. “Taught me a few things they did, said you’d be the master at it after they see you had no teeth.”  									****************      Eventually the elusive train arrived. It’s heavy tired and dirty locomotive engine at the front creeping its way into the station. The wheels grating as steel met steel.       The pair of us and the little fella sitting there in the trains heavily airconditioned carriage as it dropped slowly south. The carriage filled with locals and one sweaty and frustrated western man who had little more to do than annoy everyone with his phone. The guy blasting out one bullshit video after the other for all and sundry to hear. But who was I to complain and intervene? This not being my country and all. So I sat there in silence, breathing deeply and rhythmically tuning the guy out in the same way I’d observed May doing whilst she’d meditated at the temple. Then once I’d done that I called out to him saying,       “Turn that shit off you stupid mindless cunt.”  But I wish I hadn’t said a word as the man then came over apologizing and began another equally annoying ritual, harping on about his wife’s buffalo in the hope that I’d give a care as we passed through level crossing after level crossing and station after station. Mixed with the odd stop next to a paddy field that seemed as though we would never ever get moving again. Evening came, which turned to night, to which morning arrived at the same time we pulled into Bangkok. 	The three of us hitting the taxi rank and finding the taxi lucky enough to take our ugly stinky asses back to Pattaya. Steve saying as he sat in the back looking past the front seats to the highway. 	“What we going there for that’s so special?”	“Your girl’s missing you.” I replied. “She hasn’t had a fight in a while and needs someone to go party with.” 	“Should hang with you then. Would’ve enjoyed it in Laos I think way you been carrying on.”Looking back to my brother, I said.	“I never did a thing.”	“Yeah, you never do.” Steve carried on replying, then he asked. “So tell me this Le, she really ask after me?” And she had, according to her sister that is. May catching me late the previous evening as the buffalo guy had shut up and I was just managing to get some sleep around midnight. The girl telling me that the restaurant had just closed and she was on her way home. The beautiful girl once again purring down the phone whilst I looked out through the trains window as it carved its way through moonlit fields. The lovely girl, telling me how she missed me and asking if I’d had a nice trip. Myself telling her back about the wonderful relaxing river boat rides and how I’d made friends with a Policeman and a Tuk Tuk driver who’d showed me the city. 	“And how’s Steve?” May had then asked.       “Oh he’s been exploring the temples and chatting with some German women who fell in love with the little fella in the hotel lobby.” May telling me back how she’d been having a good time with Le whilst pretending to be a ladyboy as she flirted with the Japanese tourists at the cabaret after photo session. 				******************It was around ten thirty in the morning when we found a room and checked into the Rock hotel by the beach. The place showing off it’s huge swimming pool, with its own sandy beach across the road from the real beach. Along with the endless supply of rock and roll memorabilia. Steve saying as he stared at a silver jacket the king of rock must have worn in the 70’s. 	“Can you imagine how many women Elvis screwed?” We took the elevator up to our room. Steve standing there in the elevator looking at a Motley crew poster. The guys staring back into the lens of the camera. One with a monster in his pants. All of them giving a look that guaranteed they’d give some guy who used to wear a silver suit a run for his money. Steve carrying on, saying,        “I think I’m going to get a suit like that guy had.”	“Whose?” I asked. “one of those guys or Elvis.” Then I carried on, as the elevator stopped at our floor.       “Helps as well if you can sing. And have a bit of charisma, if you gonna wear shit like that I think.”       “Got that, haven’t you noticed?” Steve said as he walked ahead of myself and the little fella. The two of us looking at the numbers on the walls until we found our room. Opening the door, we both stepped in, sat down and said nothing. Steve taking a shower and then sitting on the balcony looking down at the pool below. Myself still working my way through the numbers in the green flag flying Tuk Tuk drivers phone.       Half an hour later there was a knock at the door and it was the police.                				*************            They sat me in an interview room, not too unlike the one they’d had me in before. I had done nothing wrong so I had to wonder what all the fuss was about. I then heard the familiar roar of a certain car that I’d once owned pull into the car park outside and ten minutes later Soone Jungumang was sitting opposite me across the table looking fly in his nicely starched clothes. The first thing he said as he sat there staring at me for a moment, was.       “You stink.”      “Tell your guys to give me a chance to shower next time they hear I checked into a hotel.”      “What happened to your teeth?”      “How’s the car?” I answered as I completely ignored his question, and the mention of the car was all it took to set the man off.      “I love it!” he said answering me back with unbelievable enthusiasm.       “You know that things got a 2JZ Engine under that hood? Straight six turbo charged!”Whatever the fuck that was I did not know, I said.	“Yeah, of course.”	“Fucking shifts man.” 	“Good, you bring me here to talk cars, is that what it is?” It wasn’t. The man then getting straight down to business saying.      “There’s an issue, you went to Laos and came back into Thailand without registering at a border point?”	“Well I would have done that but you got me here.”	“There was a bunch of missionaries found drowned in the Mekong river the other day, and a burned out boat in Vientiane.”	“And?”	“You were there?” Soone said back.	“What’s that got to do with me?”	“That’s the question. You know anything about this?”I didn’t.	      “Same night the boat was on fire, a bunch of kids turned up at a Bhikkhunistemple in Chiang Rai. The monks there are all women, as I’m sure you already know. They refused to say who brought the children to them but the kids said it was a friendly monster.”A monster – but a friendly one - That was interesting. 	“Really?” I answered without giving it another thought.       “One of them said the monster had no teeth.”	“Well you know what kids are like, big imaginations, anyway Vientiane’s in Laos so what the fucks this got to do with you?”	“You went to Vientiane the next day.”	“Did I?” 	“Yes, and the day after you arrived a business man was stabbed and killed in the city.”	“it’s a big city? I’m sure that happens a lot.” I answered shaking my head as I wondered what the fuck this all had to do with me. So with that in mind, I said.	      “Some people deserve to die.”Fuck me you big mouth idiot. Then I saw a grin spread itself across the detectives face as he heard my words.      “Is that right?” He asked.      “Yeah, I think you need to be careful in Vientiane. Lot of gangs and shit.”       	“Is that right?” He said again.	“So I’m told, didn’t see anything bad myself.”Soone sat quiet for a moment staring at me. Then he said.	“Strangely this guy who was stabbed, we found his phone in your room.”Fuck,. 	“Yeah.” I said quickly back, “you can get some good deals at the night market over there. You should try. Maybe you can snag another car?”	“Is that right?” Soone answered again, using the same phrase but this time in a different tone. Before carrying on with.	“There was also a cop who was kidnapped and tied up.”That fucking guy, that’s what you get for being nice and giving a guy a lovely SUV instead of killing him. 	      “But he’s saying the guy who did that was Chinese.”      Atta boy, my man! 	      “So that one doesn’t add up.” Soone then said as he sat there thinking. The man carrying on once he was done, saying. “But he could be lying?”	      “What the fuck you so interested in Laos for anyway?” I asked.It was a good question and I could see the answer written all over the man’s face. Fuck all. The detective now thinking things through. He said. 	“Yeah well we’re like cousins you see, us and those guys over in Laos. We share stuff if you know what I mean. But as you say, a bunch of Laos bound Christian envoys who can’t swim? Not my problem.” Then with a grin Soone Jungumang, this cop who had a thing for souped up street cars said. “What I have got for you though since we like to share is the address’s for all the Thai numbers on that phone you picked up at that market.”					***************Fuck me, I walked out the station with Steve who’d been waiting in the police stations front lobby with the puppy, and once we were both clear of the door. I then said,	“What you doing here, thought you’d be by the pool?”Steve, just grimacing for the moment, not saying a word back. I picked up the little fella as Steve said,	“Thought you were a gonna this time - thought we’d be going to visit you at the Hilton.” The Bangkok Hilton, That infamous prison full of English drug dealers and the Ladyboys who’ve thrown people like me out of window. I said,	“Why? I’ve done nothing wrong.”And I hadn’t, well not in this country that is, and I had no intention any time soon of popping over to Laos on a visa run or to buy a counterfeit watch. 	We hit the hotel for a second time. Steve stopping again to look at the king of rock’s big collared silver suit from the 70’s. Then again to the picture of Motley Crew in the same elevator heading up. Steve saying as he did. 	“You know these guys used to line up women and fuck them one after the other in their hotel suites after a gig?” I said,	“That was the 80’s, can’t pull disrespectful shit like that these days Steve.” I said back in my best big brother patronizing tone. 	“tell that to those two frauline’s in Vietnam.” Steve said back quickly as big smirk spread across his face. 	“We weren’t in Vietnam Steve.” I said back to him as I shook my head and wondered if the kid had any clue about anything. Steve saying back as his little brain soaked up that little nugget of confusion.” 	“We weren’t?” “No.” I answered. “Where were we then.” Steve asked as the doors opened. 	“We were on the information highway, because I now know where your girls husband is.” Steve turning to me as soon as he heard the words come out of my mouth. The man looking worried now as soon as I’d spoken. He said.	“Well, have a shower before you go causing any more trouble would you, the dogs been complaining. And this time, take those boots of when you do. I think the only reason those cops let you go was cause you stink.”      I did that, took a shower, and I washed my shorts and socks and T shirt. Then I put them on a chair on the balcony in the sun to dry and after walked about the room in a towel for a bit. Steve watching me as he sat on the bed, playing with his phone. He then said,	“Can’t you ever sit down and relax?”But he knew I couldn’t. Not ever really. It was the way I was. The simple way I was made, in my DNA so to speak. And the reason I’d done so well with the little company I’d put together that gave us the cash to stay in a suite at the Rock Hotel. I said, 	“Guys in Nakhom Si Thamarat.”	“Who?” Steve answered, but I was certain he already knew the answer. 	“Husband.”Taking a deep breath and putting his phone down Steve said. 	“Listen, give it up will you. I’ll pay you back the cash okay. I’ll go home now, I’ll get a bullshit job on a rig in the middle of winter to do so. I just don’t want you or me doing any more midnight escapes across fucking rivers and tying up cops and shit anymore.” Ignoring him I said. 	“yeah we should go down there, see where he lives - I liked it when we were in that neighbourhood last time. All them coconut groves. Lots of them monkeys remember?”					**************      Come evening I’d met May at the far end of walking street. Her sitting across the table from me as we ate a meal at a place on the water. Myself purposely not drinking so as not to destroy the moment. May with a glass of wine. The little fella sitting on my lap. May looking more beautiful than ever. Attracting attention as usual from the western women who no doubt wondered what she was doing with an ugly fuck like myself. May telling me again as she watched me rub my tongue across where my teeth used to be.	“I found a dentist for you.”  	“Thanks.”	“They said, they’d fit you with some false ones until you can get some permanent implants. Good ones as well, Swiss, like I told you before.” But I’d never been one to hide behind any kind of facia.	“I’m good.” I said, “for now that is. I’ll wait for the implants.”May staring at me as she took in the words I’d just said. 	“Really?”	“Yeah.”It was the way I was, I didn’t care. Unless I wanted to eat an apple that is. So I needed to find another knife for that. How many people had I seen throughout my life that had lost their front nashers, especially growing up where I had. Some choosing to hide their smiles and laughter with their hand as they spoke. Others doing the opposite and not giving a shit. I was it seemed of the latter.	“Okay.” May said as she shrugged it off. 	“How’s Le?” I asked, changing the subject.	“Good - lost her job though at the show. So that’s it for now, for the little bit of extra cash I’d get for pretending to be a boy.”	“She did?” I said, surprised.	“Yes, some Korean guy got a little too fresh. Touched her titties.”	“And?” I asked as I smiled showing May my missing teeth. 	“And? Well you can work that out I’m sure. She took him out pretty quick. But she’s so hot, they’ll forget about that at some point and ask her back. Some people forget these girls are young men. They see a beautiful girl, all slim and sexy and say bad words and the next thing they know they’re wearing a six inch heal in the side of their head. They can get quite nasty you know. I mean the other day I heard a guy got thrown out of a window in Boy’s Town.”	“Really?” I said, as I remembered how much it hurt when I’d hit those motorbikes lined up on the side of the road. “That’s not good - was he okay?” I asked already knowing the answer to the question. 	“Hospital…. Probably minimum.” May answered, I asked.	“You ever been to Nakhom Si Thamarat?” 	“Yes, it’s nice. But it’s not like here.”       “No where’s like here.” I answered.And I wasn’t wrong. This city, Pattaya, I was for the moment frequenting, being almost a living breathing cesspool. All for the sake of spending time with this beautiful girl. May then asking.	“When you go, do you mind if I come say hello?”  	“I’d love it.” I said, already wondering what would happen if things went the same way they had the previous few days. Then May surprised me by saying.“I’ve got a problem, somethings worrying me Sandy”“You need me to buy you a buffalo?” I asked straight back after listening to that sad guy on the train drone on.May sat there looking to me for a moment and then slowly it built until she was laughing so hard she had to keep one hand covering her face and the other on her chest. Then as she stopped and composed herself the girl asked me in a serious tone.      “ No, it’s okay. I don’t want you to buy me a buffalo. Why would you ask this?”      “There was this guy on the train we were just on,” I answered. “The guy drove me mad. The man lived up north somewhere, said his wife kept telling him her father’s buffalo was sick or had died and they needed a new one. Except every time he went to see them, to him the buffalo looked identical. So he went out and bought himself one of those permanent marker pens and put his initials on it. Next time he bought them a new one. He told them it must have been reincarnated as it had his same initials on the new buffalos ass. They said that was an old buffalo they’d had for ages and that the new one he’d bought was busy working in the rice fields. But they’d never mentioned before that they had a second one. Every time before they just said they only got one, and it was dying and if it did - they’d all starve…. poor guy. Got himself in a bit of a jam I think. So now maybe the family’s gonna have to find some other mug to buy them buffalos as he’s left home. Come here I think or Phuket.”	“Oh, the poor guy,” was all she said after she had sat there listening to the man’s tale of woe. Then she carried on saying, 	“But don’t you worry, we don’t keep buffalo’s, so you’re off the hook. For now. No, what I was wanting to tell you was this. I took your advice about living my life and not my sisters.”	“Good.” I replied, surprised for once that someone had actually listened to anything I had to say. Not that I could remember giving the advice in the first place though. May then said with a grin.       “I was going to surprise you both in Lao, but I got offered a modelling job in Bangkok, so I took it.”      “Good for you.” I said, as I wondered what I’d have done over there, or Steve for that matter, had she suddenly showed up in Vientiane with her sister. Then May said.	“I feel guilty.”	“Why?.”	“The job – it was for lingerie I hope you don’t mind?”I didn’t – not in the slightest. 	      “Don’t be.” I said, as I pictured the woman in her delicate’s in my mind, and having a thing for lingerie after spending a large part of my life gawping at models in it, felt the rush of blood hit my loins. 	“I’ve never taken those jobs before because I’ve heard men use the pictures - if you know what I mean - and I didn’t like the thought of that. You know, staring at me naked, even if it was a photo.” May said as she took a deep breath. The young lady maybe having been worried about my opinion.	“They do that?” I asked feigning shock.	“Oh yeah – creepy guys do. Anyway, it was for a new company – Vie Amour.”	“French?” I asked, 	“No Chinese, pretending to be French – I’m told they’re handing out flyers in the malls.”	“Oh?” I answered, as I wondered how many times as a youth I’d knocked one out to some fit lingerie catalogue model. But that was not Victoria’s secret that was my own very personal secret and May was never to know this. I said,         “Yeah I masturbate to flyers all the time.”Fuck!  What was wrong with me?      May said seemingly without any judgement at all, “yes you mentioned that.”       What the fuck!Before continuing with, “I’ve got some stills, maybe, they sent them to me on the weekend. I’ll send them to you.” And then she opened her phone and showed the photo session stills, and oh my god did she look sexy. The girl all slender and toned. Looking as though she’d just stepped out of a lingerie showroom in her lacy bra, panties and heels. The girl looking back at me through the lens, her eyes soft but with attitude. I looked closer at her panties that left little to the imagination. May asking nervously as I stared at the photos on her phone,	“Your my man, so do what you do with these - it’s okay - what do you think?”And unable to stop myself, I said. 	“Fuck me.” May smiling and saying straight back. 	“I thought you’d think that, but I wish I was as pretty as my sister.” Then before I could say another word May surprised me by saying quite matter-of-factly.      “I was thinking of you a lot while I was in Bangkok. Maybe it’s time to move things along.”Okay? I then looking into the beautiful woman’s deep brown eyes and getting the gist of what she meant felt the sudden uncontrollable movement of blood heading south as I heard May then say.      “So since there’s no drama going on for once, I was thinking when we’ve finished here this evening we could go dancing and when we’ve had enough of that I’d like to ask if I can come to your room.” The young lady wearing the cutest of grins as she looked straight into my eyes and nervously played with her hair. 	“Sure.” I said, looking back at her and not actually too sure which of the two activities worried me more. The dancing yeah, I could maybe hope the dance floor was packed and just hold the girl close to me to get myself through that part. The bit where she comes back to my room and we do the business. Well that would be a different story. Yes, we’d spent a lot of time in the room together in Samui, but that was on top of the sheets, with her just cuddling me plus the odd kiss. Then that had changed when my teeth were removed by that shit head. The teeth thing though, yeah, that could be an advantage now if things got carried away. Just like those girls had told Steve - that would be my ace - If it came to that - then I would be king.But she didn’t need to know that. I’d keep that little weapon to myself and holstered for now. So I said.       “I got some tips from a couple of rug munchers on how to eat muff, so you’re in luck, seeing I lost my teeth.”					***************	We went to the Marine club, heading up into its heart via a long escalator we’d stepped onto at the entrance on Walking Street. All the girls floating about in their hot outfits. The lights moving, the girls dancing. Western men of all ages, shapes and sizes as far as my eyes could see. Men in their twenties acting fifty. Men in their fifties thinking they’re twenty again. The place packed with the smell of sweat and Axis. May moving up to me and talking into my ear because of the music, saying.	“You like it?” Not really. But she was never going to know that. Twisting my head so as my toothless mouth was to her ear, I said,	“Hate it.” May looking to me with a smile as she heard my words. The beautiful girl thinking I was joking. What I did like though was all the other girls that were hovering about. If that’s what they were? The girls moving around alone or in small groups, more obsessed with their phones than their real lives. 	“Shall we dance?” May asked.  Shall we dance?….. Good question. I looked to the dance floor. Worrying the fuck about how much of a fool I was about to look. So this is what people do in the evenings? I then watched the rows of single men standing alone. Holding their beer for company as the girls made faces at their phones cameras. Grabbing another much needed headshot. All these men here while I’d been out there trying to save the world one pedo at a time. 	Feeling my reluctance May took her slender hand in mine, and walked away pulling me gently through the crowd as she led me to the dance floor. Finding her own space she then held my hands in hers and looked up to me smiling with her beautiful brown eyes as I rocked myself from side to side like some big fucking bear. The music thumping. May calling out,	“I love it! I never thought I’d get you here. Le and I had a bet.”Great - so that was it. I was now sport. 	      “How much?” I asked as I took Mays lead rocking from one big boot to the next. 	“Coca cola.” May answered as she looked down to my boots and hairy bare legs. “Yeah, Steve told her he had never seen you on the dance floor in a club and no one ever would.”	“Is that right?” I answered, with a smile.	“I’m just playing.” She then called out as I looked above her wondering how long it would be before I’d see Steve come in the door. If he was not here already with the sister that is. The whole club thing being some sort of conspiracy that the man had concocted up earlier in the day whilst I’d been sweating it out in an interrogation room at the cop shop.       I looked around. Through a sea of people, from one side of the club to the other. Everyone moving, dancing, standing, drinking, kissing, posing. Girls dressed in style, others wearing so little they needed have bothered. Myself paranoid in the feeling that somewhere in amongst it all was my brother waiting to pounce. But it wasn’t Steve I saw in the crowd as I looked around towards the other side of the club. It was Sherri, and she was with her husband. 	I stopped moving as I watched them for a moment in shock. Then I heard May call out as she tugged on my hands asking.	“What is it?” Quickly I looked to her and said as I tried to keep the two of them there in the corner of my eye. 	“I thought I saw Steve.”	“I hope not.” May said back. “I wanted tonight to be just you and I.”You and I and now Sherri and her shit head husband. 	“Same.” I said, and I wasn’t lying. Not that I could. For the one time in my life I had a genuinely beautiful girl wanting to come back to my room with no other reason than she wanted to, I now had two shitheads to deal with in between.      Not letting go of my hands, almost as though she was worried I would run away. May then moved closer to me. The beautiful women laid the side of her face on my chest, tucking her head under my chin. I could smell her hair and the slightest scent of French perfume as she rocked beneath me. Hearing her words as she whispered into my chest. The girl saying “lovely man lovely man.” Over and over.       So there I stood, me on the dance floor with the most gorgeous girl I’d ever met pinned against my chin. The couple who’d fleeced my brother on the other side of the club. One who destroyed men’s lives, and the other who did the same but included children in the mix. One thing I could not understand is that if they were an item then why did she tell May where I could find this husband. It didn’t make sense. Then it did as I saw a man in his fifties, dressed to the nines in a newly tailored suit walking through the crowd towards them. The guy sporting a grin the size of a quarter moon as he reached Sherri in amongst the crowd and kissed her firmly on the lips. And as soon as he did the husband was gone. Then as if by chance May pulled herself away from me and asked,      “Do you mind if I go to the washroom.” And that right there and then was the opportunity I needed.      As soon as we were off the dance floor and May was out of sight, I was off. Heading in the direction of the escalator. Keeping to the side of the club I moved myself through the crowd. Then I saw the husband. The man closer now. The man checking out the talent, looking well dressed in designer clothes and new shoes as he headed for the exit.      I drew closer and then closer still as I gently pushed my way through a crowd that seemed to be growing larger. Then I was on him, caught up, and right behind the guy as he hit the top of the escalator. And just as he was about to step on and take the ride down I reached forward, grabbed him, and had my arm around his neck before his new shoes had hit the moving steps made from steel. Leaning back, I held him as the mixed crowd of tourists and locals stood in disbelief. Then I felt the first blow as one of the security guards hit me. Then another, and another, and another. As from what I could see six or more Thais reigned blows down upon my body and head.            Seven seconds, eight seconds, nine….. ten,       I counted in my head as the husband lashed out with his hands and feet and I felt punch after punch and kick after kick hit my body. The security thumping me hard with their fists and kicking me with their feet as I kept the pressure on the man’s windpipe. Knowing the man would be unconscious within no more than another few seconds. Then, just as his body began to go limp as it naturally had to, I felt my legs sweep out from underneath me as I fell to the floor. With a thump we both hit the ground and I heard the husband gasp for air as I felt my grip loosen. Then as soon as I had heard it, the prick was up and with what little strength he had left, he threw himself towards the top on the moving elevator and in half a tumble and half a cognizant effort, the man stumbled himself down the stairs and was gone from sight into the street crowd below.      Standing I looked about myself and felt the welts on my head from all the kicks and thumping I’d taken. The security guards now loving the fight they were in, along with the eight against one odds.        The men all standing in an arc around me. Holding their fighting posture the best they could. I looked back inside the club. The guards all waiting for me to make the next move. All of them now knowing they were not dealing with any ordinary drunk, having just given me their best shots only to see me now standing and ready to go for more. I said,      “You can go fly down there.” as I pointed to the bottom of the escalator, “or I go in there.” As I then pointed to the interior of the club. Then slowly I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a wad of one thousand baht notes and handed them to the nearest guard to me, as I said.  “There you go - make friends.” As I pushed the palms of my hands towards the floor as a sign of peace. Then with a nod that told me I’d just bought them all off, I made my way back inside. And as soon as I was back at the dance floor where May had left me waiting, she reappeared again. The girl looking to me as she arrived, saying.      “You look hot.”      “Thanks.” I replied, jokingly and wondered what marks those security pricks had left. And yes she was correct, I was very hot in fact, and I hurt, my body and legs aching  from the kick in. Then I heard her say through the noise of the music.“A girl just came into the washroom said there was something going on. Maybe a fight I think?”“Really?” I answered.“Yes - with security, and….. I don’t know how to say this but when I was in there I saw that the girl from Samui’s here. She came in. That’s when someone said there was trouble and I had this terrible feeling inside that it was you and by bringing you here, I’d bought trouble on again.” “I’m fine.” I answered, and I was. I hurt yes, in places. But overall I was okay, at leastthis time they had not hit my face.Then May said,“I know I’m the one who wanted to come here, but I have to be honest - I don’t feelcomfortable being in a place where that girl is. What if that thug Muay Thai boyfriend is here and there’s trouble again?” Myself knowing he wasn’t there, but I would not have cared if he was. As far as I was concerned my beef with Lee Wilkes being done. Despite my need for dental work. Then May said,      “Also the GoGo bars will close soon and the place will be packed with girls, and that’ll be a problem.”       Problems like that, I could handle.       I looked about at all the lovely ladies already here. Then to the sad fucks standing alone to scared to talk. However, any one of them could have easily been myself had May not seen something in me I did not know existed. So we left, myself heading to the door with this beautiful girl on my arm. The doormen wary as I came towards them. Lining up as we arrived and nodding knowingly to me as we stepped onto the elevator and rode it down. Feeling the heat from the road as we dropped away from the air conditioned space above.      As always Walking Street was hot and packed. It’s usual crowd of hustlers working their wares standing territorial in their spots. Selling food, selling shows and sadly some selling themselves.       The husband out there in amongst them all somewhere. Two times now the little rat had managed to escape me. It was something pretty much only Houdini would have accomplished. He was slippery though, like one of mothers greasy turkeys about to hit the oven in the holiday season.      We took a baht bus along the beach road. May sitting on the hard wooden bench with ease. Myself with my ass struggling to fit, reminiscent of Vientiane.       May not speaking as we hit the hotels elevator and stood there as I felt the floor beneath us rising, pressing the soles of my feet to the worn leather inner soles of my boots. Myself wondering as we went whether we’d be opening the door to find Steve getting his ass fucked in the middle of an Eiffel Tower. That would put a damper on the romance.       We opened the door, with I feel the both of us half expecting Steve to be there with Le. But we found nothing. Just a bed with it’s nice clean linen sheets and spread, and the Little Fella asleep on the balcony.      May standing there in her nice dress that reached her knees. The girl, so beautiful as she looked at me with her smile and her long dark hair. Boy was I the lucky one, In a sea of tricksters and whores I’d found the one without the sick buffalo. Or maybe she’d found me. Taking the lead, May pulled me to her and kissed me on the lips. Myself conscious of my missing teeth. May kissing me strong as she stood up on her tip toes so as her lips could reach mine. May speaking to me as our mouths touched.      “Take off my dress, I have a surprise for you.”Her words messing with my head as Steve’s constant dialogue bounced throughout my brain.       Slowly I reached around the back of her dress and undid its clasp. Then finding the little zipper I pulled the it down unfastening it until I felt it drop between us and pool on the floor at our feet. Gently May pulled away slightly, as I felt her hand come up to my face and her fingers softly touch my forehead and stroke downwards closing my eyes. Hearing her voice say,      “Close your eyes, I have something I want to show you.”And then as I felt our lips part leaving only her taste in my mouth, I stood there in my own self enforced darkness. Filled with only patterns of white and red which floated in my mind.      “Are you ready,” I then heard her ask. As my heart raced and the words, don’t have a dick, don’t have a dick, swam around my mind. And then she said it.      “Don’t be angry,” and unable to keep my eyes closed, I opened them to see May standing naked in her heels and the same lingerie she was modelling in the photo. With my mouth open, I stared at her in shock, as I felt my dick hardening in my pants.      Fuck me, I’d seen a fair few unbelievable strippers in my time on a weekend up in grand prairie or Fort McMurray. But May was definitely a notch higher, if that was possible. Maybe it was the girls pose. Maybe the lack of drugs in her system that fuelled these lithe dancers I’d watched existence. Maybe it was just May’s smile and that instead of being surrounded by one hundred oleaginous drunk men it was just me with her in the room. For once I had a girl who was there only for me and we were alone, because it was something she wanted to do. I said.“Thank goodness, I thought for a moment you had a dick.”“No that’s my sister.” May answered as she span herself around ignoring my comment as she reproduced the same look and pose she’d given the photographer in the photo studio. Then as I stood there stunned with my gums showing. May moved into me closer and pulling me back down to her, began to kiss me more softly and tenderly than I’d ever been kissed in my life. 	I took of my shorts and T shirt and stood there in the room wearing nothing other than a hard on and my work boots. May looking to my large frame and then my footwear, saying.	“I think you’ll need to take them off in the shower?”And that’s where we headed next. May now undressed. Her French lingerie designed and made in some Chinese sweat shop now laying neatly folded on the towel rack. We stood in the shower together naked as the spray dropped down upon us from the large rainfall shower nozzle. May kissing me as she felt my muscles. Myself kissing her back as my large hands stroked her soft and tender skin. The woman holding my neck. Pulling herself up and sliding herself down onto my dick.       And there she stayed, her body pushed down upon mine. Her insides tight as they gripped me. Her breathing becoming stronger as we kissed. Then feeling as though my cock was wrapped as tight as a sausage stuffed into a six inch velvet subway sandwich, with the slightest of movement I felt her push down on me as she groaned. Once, then twice, and on the third stroke my body could take no more and overtaking my mind it decided it was time to unload and for it all to end. 	“Oh?” said May as she realised what had just happened. Myself now embarrassed saying.	“Yeah sorry, It’s because you’re not a hooker.”Fuck! 	“Oh?” Was all May said again. As I then remembered the vital love making technique tip the two ladies in Vientiane had mentioned to Steve regarding my missing teeth. So without another word and in full knowledge that I’d be swallowing my own odious cream from within a delicious pie, I dropped to my knees and with the rainfall shower crashing down upon my head I went to chow town.       Doing my best to remember a certain head and tongue movement Steve had revealed during an embarrassing forced visual tutorial he’d demonstrated on the train to Bangkok. The man giving me a play by play of the show Mr and Mrs Hamburg had put on for him whilst the three of them wasted the day away trying to make babies. My brother sitting there in the train carriage, moving his head up and down and side to side at speed. Flapping his cheeks and stretching his tongue out like an alien. Slapping it against his lips as he worked one finger and then three into some tight imaginary orifice as I looked on in horror and listened to the little fella bark. Wishing at the time on that train I could forget what I’d just witnessed, but then in the shower being glad I had paid attention to a second hand lesson in the grand old art of cunnilingus given by a dominant lesbian and her wife.       May breathing hard as she lay back in the shower with he ass and back squashed tight against the glass. Her right leg laying heavy on my shoulder as I felt the unconscious movement of her hands on my head. Knowing that for once Steve had been correct with such guarded info, after hearing May suggest how it may be a good thing that I delay getting my teeth fixed.	Then we were done, May standing there in the bathroom with her hair wet wrapped in a big soft white fluffy towel. Myself naked with a sore neck and mouth feeling like a suzerain with my new found power. Remembering also having felt like a chump the last time I’d been to chow town when the girl had spent the whole time on her phone.       Staring at the bruises on my back courtesy of the doormen. May asked in a now worried tone.	“Are you okay?”	“Yeah my necks okay?” I answered in complete innocence.	“No your back?” Say it’s from that prick in Samui. Tell her it’s deep tissue stuff. Takes a time to come out. So I said, “it’s from that club.”Fuck! You idiot! 	      “Okay.” May said as she stared back at me, “okay.”					      **************      We went to the bedroom, seeing the little fella now sitting by the balcony sliding door wagging his little tail desperately wanting to come in. Then we went to bed. The two of us, with a little dog laying at my feet on the covers. Me still kissing my girl, my jaw still aching. Wondering as we kissed, how on earth the girls who’d taught Steve this great skill did these things on a continual basis. Practice makes perfect I suppose, as they say. Then we made love again. This time, without filling up the pie as soon as the train hit the tunnel. May, making me feel special, rubbing both her hands up and down my spine gently as we did. Then almost with perfect timing as both of us finished the deed, the phone rang and it was the concierge telling me I had a guest waiting for me by the reception.             				*************              	It was almost six am when I arrived down in the lobby to discover the guest was Sherri. This young woman who’d asked me to unload on her tits. And then straight after accused me of asking if I could do the same. The girl sitting there now like the picture of innocence I knew her not to be. The girl looking like a stop out in the outfit she’d worn to the club. I said, as I reached her and stood there in my shorts and boots rubbing my neck.	“Steve’s not here.”	“I not here for your brother.” She said as she nervously looked up at me, her face full of uncertainty. 	“I’m here to speak to you.” I stared at her for a moment taking that one in. Then said back suddenly confused. 	“For someone who claimed not to speak English when we first met in that bar, you do well.” And then asked straight after I’d realized I was waiting for an explanation that was never going to arrive.      “How’s champ?” but she didn’t understand, so I put it another way I was sure she’d understand.	“How’s that cunt of a boyfriend?” 	“He’s not my boyfriend, besides that guys gone back to America.” I sat down and looked to the elevator wondering if curiosity would get the better of May and I’d see her appearing in the lobby anytime soon. Then I looked to the display case showing the gold stage suit Elvis had worn when he’d played once in Chicago. Then by the door I saw a group of monks sitting quietly in their orange robes. Turning back to Sherri, I said.	“Okay go on?”	“I looked for you all over, then they told me you were here.”	“Who’s they?” I asked showing the girl as I spoke my missing teeth that her boyfriend removed with his foot. The girl averting her eyes as I did, turning her head to the monks. Then I asked as we sat there. Her in her high heels - me in my untied big boots.       “So why are you here?”      “My husband is here.       No kidding,       “He’s here, there was a problem with that boat and I think that was you. He’s come back. I think you know that though - He’s saying he needs to start again.”       “Is that so?”       “But it’ll take a long time. I’ve a new man who wants to be in my life.”      A new man? The one I saw earlier maybe? My goodness, she moves quick.	      “He’s in love with me. But he’s not for me. He’s not strong like you.” Strong like me - what was the fuck was that about?        “My husband - he’s desperate for money now, he wants me to go with this man. He’s telling me I have to pretend to love him. Thinks he can get me to talk the guy into sending some money.”      “Same with Steve then?” I said back quickly. Sherri, snapping straight back.      “No! Steve? I loved Steve and he loved me.” Is that so? Poor Steve, getting himself sucked in by the girls smile and big titties. I asked,       “Again - why are you here?”        “All I want is to have a good life. Someone attacked my husband at that club tonight. I think it was you. I know he’s scared of you. Because of his gambling he can’t go to the police or anyone else for protection. So he’ll go and wait it out with his motheruntil your visa runs out and you have to leave.”      Visa or not - I’m staying until I find him.And as if she could read my mind, Sherri then said.      “If you overstay. He’ll tell immigration where you are. He’s done it before.”      More like you’ve both done it before.And I was about to say just that when Sherri surprised me by saying.             “I told you where you could find him the last time and this time I know he’ll be hiding at his mother’s and I know where his mother has money hidden away from him. If you can get to him soon then it is good for everyone.”      “And?”       “And – you get your cash and I get on with my life.”       “And?” I asked again as Sherri then looked straight at me, holding my stare. Changing the subject, she said,      “When they grow up, they’ll know what you have done for them.”       “Who?”“The children - my husband, told me you killed those men they found in the river. The children, they’re young now but when they’re older, they’ll know you saved them. But me? Me - no one saved me.” The women said, as some deep seated pain of a horror seemed to well up from within. Memories locked away, parceled up, packed into a sealed up compartmentalized box and left in a place entitled pain somewhere within. A box that for so many is too agonizing to reopen.       Turning her head, she looked again to the monks, and just stared at them for the longest time. The women drawing whatever slice of serenity and peace their presence could offer. Then as her body began to calm, Sherri turned back to me and quietly said.       “I was one of those children. I was just like them before. I was on that boat.” She then looked down for a moment at her ample breasts as the picture of those terrified kids hung for a moment in my mind. Raising my head back up I saw that she was again waiting to speak some more. Looking me straight in the eye and as serious as a heart attack she carried on saying.       “But I was kind of lucky, I grew these early.” The girls eyes dropping momentarily from mine as she looked back down to her chest. “and when I did, those sick men were no longer interested. But my husband back then suddenly was. So the luck didn’t last and I never got to leave.”      “Okay?” I said as I did my best to follow and wondering when she’d get to the point.      “Where he’s staying, his mother keeps money hidden from him under her mattress so he doesn’t just lose it gambling. She’s sick now though. I’ll tell you where you’ll find him and the money also. Then maybe as I say I can get on with my life, same as May and her little brother have.”      “Why do you say them?” I asked confused.      “Because when I was young girl - they were on that boat too.”            				****************                  Have you ever had that feeling when everything just lines up perfectly and the world becomes clear. The most beautiful women I’ve ever seen just happens to pull up next to me on her motorbike. Let’s me follow her along the road in a manner not to dissimilar to how the Little Fella follows me. Invites me in for dinner, invites me for drinks, calls me all the time showering me with love.             Me? A great big brute of a man, for what? To drag me into all this crap. This shit storm real life drama my brother had suddenly become a bit player in.       Along with me.       I sat down and stared at a pair of high heeled shoes once worn by Blondie. The monks now gone. Sherri in tears. Sitting in the same chair, playing with her phone as security watched on. Fuck me – Fuck me. How could I seriously be so stupid? All this shit, and on top of it all, I’d lost my fucking teeth. Me, the big warrior, the big hearted fool, the fucking crusader. Who Steve knew would come crashing into town to make it all okay again. Fuck him, Fuck him and his manipulations. I didn’t need this, we didn’t need this straight after dad!      So I waited. Waited in the same spot. Just sat there staring at the door and a pair of Jimmy Choo’s or whatever the fuck they were. Awaiting Steve who I knew would come wandering back in from whatever latest sexual adventure he’d found himself in. And then he arrived, looking like a mouse that had just found the cheese. The kid staggering, holding onto the wall with both hands like a Rockstar as he made his way through the reception.      The kid stopping to stare for what seemed an eternity at Elvis’s gold suit before he eventually found his way to me. Only to be hit straight in the chops before he could speak with a good old fashioned punch delivered by a big brother in a manner he so rightly deserved.             			******************                  I sat there on the end of the bed in the bedroom and listened to the security guard and hotel manager talking outside. Steve pacing back and forth, holding his jaw. May now long gone. The beautiful girl who loved me so much, this stunning model of a women who dripped velvet from her mouth and honey from her snatch. Crying as she’d left, after I’d walked into the room and quietly told her to get the fuck out. Myself saying to Steve as I ignored the puppy.      “How could you do this to me?” Steve saying straight back, holding his hands up in innocence.      “How could I do what to you? I haven’t done anything.” The guy using my line. His voice in complete honesty.       “I swear I haven’t done anything.” He said again. “I don’t know what you are talking about?” So I sat there, trying to take it all in. The motorbike meeting, the restaurant, the drinks, me getting obliterated drunk, waking up not knowing where I was or what had happened. Fucking roofied, more like. Then the coincidental meeting in Samui, my teeth, this fiancé Sherri, with her big titties, chatting outside on the deck, the husband hiding along the beach. The party boat, the Christians who should have learned to swim….. and… and…. and….      “Fuck!” I said again.      “I don’t know what’s going on,” said Steve confused.      “What’s going on for fuck sake is that your lovely ex fiancée and this fucking May and her tranny fucking brother all know each other – they all spent their chid hood years being abused and passed about on that boat.”      “What boat?” Steve asked in such a genuinely confused fashion that left little doubt he knew as little as me.” I said,       “You remember that burnt out wreck in the river?”       He did.            “Yeah that one. Well they were all on it as kids getting abused by nonces.”      “How’s that their fault?” Steve asked shocked. And it wasn’t. I then said back quickly not wanted to think about answering such an innocent and legitimate question,      “Your ex was in a club last night with some sad old fuck, then she came here after. Her husband was at that club too - this time I nearly had him - if not for Jackie Chan and his mates. May took me there, both of them schemed that one up I’m sure?”      “I was with some Russian chicks. Skinny ones with long legs, you know, the lingerie model type you like. You should have seen them.” Steve said straight back, doing his best to no doubt change the subject. I said, letting him know I knew exactly what he was up too.       “Don’t give me that shit.”      “I’m not! I’m just saying….”        “So then your ex,” I butted in, shutting his bullshit down. “she comes here, starts pouring her heart out about wanting the same life as May and shit, then tells me they know each other from old.”      “Yeah you said.” Steve replied, then followed it up with,      “Let me know when you get to the bit when I was deserved of being punched out.” And from what I could see after the dust had settled now in the clear light of day, the simple fact was is that he didn’t. So being the honorable person I am, and doing the right thing I said. 	“You got thumped because you’re a cunt.” 					************      All I wanted to do now was get the fuck out of dodge. Get away from this hotel decorated with old clothes which had once been covered in puke. Clothes gathered from the floors of wild and crazy musicians homes by people who worshipped them with no lives of their own. People only too happy to remove their idols stains, ironing them out in the name of rock and roll memorabilia. I needed to get away from this sleazy city with its bar girls and the fucking mongers who they fed off. Get away from the humid heat and the noisy streets and the motorcycles that never seemed to end. What the fuck was I doing here, seriously, what – the – fuck? A stranger, in a new world. Eating out of the hand of the people who fed me their problems and bullshit. I was sick of sorting out other people’s troubles in other people’s countries – I had enough on my plate as it were with my father. So that was it, fuck it I was leaving. But, and it was a big but. I had been told where the money I’d come all this way to retrieve was, and knowing this I wasn’t one to be going back empty handed. It was something I knew I could never live with if I did. So with this in mind, I was going to be having one last talk with this Sherri.       We arranged to meet her on the beach, about half way between soi six and walking street, and strangely it was the exact spot where I’d sat on the day I’d arrived. The girl in her high heels, looking over her shoulder at the road for most of the time whilst we spoke. Steve completely over the woman. The young man not even bothering to show up as he made the most of what time he had left in this city made for sin.       What I also wanted to know is if it was true about May and her sister, then had she helped in the orchestration of myself heading up to the river and then onto Vientiane. If she was as much a victim as Sherri, then why had she seemed so coquettish and kept so quiet about it all. Getting straight to the point, I asked.       “So May knew who I was and why I was here from the start?”      “Yes.” Sherri said as she looked me straight in the eye.       “You told her?”      “I told her you maybe coming. I told her my fiancé’s brother was a fighter and had killed a man who’d stole from him a year ago.”      He did – he’d said that - what the fuck Steve? I then asked in shock.	“Steve tell you that did he?” He had - The fucking fool. 	“He told me all about you. How you’re rich because you have that company in the oil industry and how proud he is of you.”He did - he is? Well at least that was something nice for once.	“We were hoping you’d come. And you did.”	“Who’s we?”	“May and I.”	“So you both played me?”	“No, not me.” Sherri then said. “I never asked anything of you.” Well that was not exactly true.	“At the beach, you came and told May to tell me where I could find your husband?”	“No, at the beach, I came to say sorry about that young kid kicking Le and the other idiot who in the end you beat up. And to ask her why she’d bought her sister along after she’d promised me she would not let her near Steve.” Sherri said angrily. Then before I could get a word about May she was off again saying. “Ladyboy or not - that was sneaky. You think I was with that Wilkes man don’t you? Well I wasn’t, we were just friends. She knew that. I ask you, put yourself in my shoes - have a manipulating vicious husband like mine - Then you’ll be hanging around with idiots like Lee Wilkes for protection.”	“You had Steve?” I asked but as soon as the words left my lips, deep down I already knew the answer.	“No.” Sherri said back. “Put it this way - Steve and I had a play fight once and I won. So when my husband turned up again in Samui. It was obvious you hated me so I went and hung with those fighter guys.” Not really giving a care about her impression of myself or the girls excuses for dumping Steve the way she had. I eventually managed to say,	“Tell me more about May.” 	“She told you I came to the beach in Samui to tell you about that boat?”She had.	“Well that’s not true. She knew you’d thrown that guy out of the window. So she must have told you hoping you’d head up there.”	“What guy?” I asked. Sherri saying, “Okay, play that game.” straight back as she looked out to sea for the first time since she’d sat down. 	      So it was true - I was being played all along by beautiful May. The girl loving me and manipulating me into retribution for her and Le and this girl sitting before me now, along with all the other poor children that had suffered on that boat. I could see her point. I doubt many people like me strolled into town who had the balls to do what I had over the last while. Steve certainly must have bigged me up into super hero status. Although the idiot should have kept his mouth shut. Taking a deep breath and moving on, for the moment I let go of the deceit and asked the girl as she sat there looking out across the sea.      “So he keeps money under his mother’s bed?”       “No, his mother keeps money he’s given her under the bed. If she didn’t he’d end up gambling it away. But now the mother is sick.” Sherri answered, as she played with her highlighted hair. “So soon the bed will be empty and she won’t be there as she’ll either die in it  or die in hospital. Then as soon as she’s gone one way or the other all there will be left are a few guys sitting out front that’s all but they’ll be drunk.”       “They know about the money?”       “Only three people know where she hides it. His mother, myself, and now you. And the mother does not know that I know. But my husband is suspicious that she has money hidden somewhere so he’ll be looking as soon as she’s out of that room.”       “Okay.” I said, as Sherri reached down and played with the little fella as he lay in the sand at my feet. I looked to her fingers and her nicely cut nails. Then to her eyes and her lips. Yeah I could see why Steve was so besotted now. I could see the appeal. There was something about her. Then catching me staring Sherri said,      “You think I’m a whore because you saw me in that bar – well I’m not - I need money to live like everyone. And the money is there, so I that’s where I go.” Then with a look that I could only call sadness, this Sherri stared into my eyes,       “I’ve never taken money for sex, despite what you think. My job in those places is to draw men in.” Sherri continued, the nice smooth skin of her breasts exposed by her tight blouse jiggling as she gave her ample bosum a little shake. The girl saying as she did,       “get them horny with these.” Staring at them as they settled. The soft caramel colored skin of her cleavage hypnotic to my eyes. Don’t stare, you fucking idiot – show some class man, And so lifting my head I said to the girl.	“Could you do that again?”Fuck! You idiot…..      Sherri ignoring me as she carried on saying,      “I’ve taken that bar money and used it to better myself with an education so one day I can leave. How else do you think I learned to speak to you in English the way I do.”       “Okay??” I said that kind of makes sense. Then I asked out of curiosity as I sucked at my missing teeth,      “where’s the champ now?”       “Who Wilkes?” Sherri asked, and before I could confirm, she carried on saying, “he’s back in Florida. His friends came here and we all hung out again. And the fool still walked about like a champion showing off his belt even after what you’d done. We went to a special bar in Patpong, Bangkok his friends knew. There’s a local Thai man there who fights Mai Thai every night at eleven. It gets quite rough. His friends arranged him to fight this guy before he went home.” Then with a satisfactory grin which spread across her face, Sherri carried on saying.       “The man who fights at the bar has little boy, and that little boy was there that night. And this fighter was not going to let some Farang beat him in front of his child - no way.”      I thought about that one as I smiled. I could just see that cunt posturing. Getting up into the ring in front of Sherri and that bunch of his boozed up friends I seen in Samui. All of them cheering him on with their screams and shouts in some seedy bar. Then getting his ass kicked by a professional who had a thousand hard fights under his belt. Sherri then said,       “he does this thing where he’d try to kick whoever he was fighting’s teeth out. Same as he did with you - like a trophy. He tried it with this guy and failed. Then karma took over and Wilkes lost his teeth. Good - Karma, yeah, good old karma.What goes around comes around as they say. What had I done to lose mine though, nothing?I’d never removed anyone’s teeth on purpose. Except that dog on the beach who deserved it. But that wouldn’t count. Or would it? So I asked,       “that go the same if I hurt a dog?”       “Yes.” Sherri answered, straight back. “Makes no difference. But it only works one way, like the bar pro he’s okay. He delivered karma he did not earn it.”       Then I thought of those Christian’s on the boat and the Tuk Tuk driver. I said not really wanting to know the answer, but asked anyway.       “You were on that boat as a kid, did any children end up in the river?”       “What do you think?” Was all Sherri said back as she stared now thoughtful out at the ocean. Then, for once she said nothing. A reel of unimaginable horror running through her mind, and in a whisper that was only to herself, she said it again,      “what do you think?”            				*****************                  I’d arranged to meet the girl at noon for a quick question. But I’d found myself still talking as the sun began to drop from the sky. The light blue horizon beyond slowly satisfying my eyes in a wonder of streaking gold and red. This girl there with me and the little fella. Sitting in her deck chair unconsciously making shapes in the sand with her delicate little feet as we watched the sun until it left us with its tiny flash of green.       Sherri seemingly comfortable. No longer looking behind herself, frightened of her own shadow as the sand fell away from her red painted toenails. The pair of us having sat, relaxing as we drank and ate whilst the afternoon wore on. This girl telling me unembarrassed about her life. Telling me about her brother also who’d been with her as a child on that party boat. And having grown up how he had and then after never really leaving. The man selling his ass at night but then taking his kids to school in the morning.       How the girl knew she had been the victim and how she had learned to switch herself off, when as a child the men had come for her. Then later how she had used her ample looks and more ample breasts to entice losers into the bars she’d worked at while she did her uttermost to save enough money to change her life.       Except with Steve, who had been different. Steve who wasn’t some sex tourist loser who was there to fuck and spread disease around town. Steve being there simply because he was hiding from something that had recently torn his life apart. The girl sitting there playing with her blonde streaked hair, telling me how she’d fallen in love with his cheeky grin and his love of life. The girl telling me how much she’d cried when she’d discovered her husband had found out about the money my mother had sent and bribed someone in the bank to take that along with everything she’d herself saved. The girl saying,       “I just couldn’t believe it when I discovered it missing. I went to the bank with my bank book to check everything was okay and it was gone. Everything - your money - my money - everything I’d worked so hard for, working in those bars. Putting up with and listening to all those losers - I knew right there and then who had it and where it was. So I jumped on the next coach and headed down south to fight it out with his mother. But when I got off the coach I saw one of those photo’s of that old monk Ajahn Phra TaSol and I went and saw him instead. Then knowing Steve would never believe me and I couldn’t go back to him, I went to Koh Samui. A week later I got word you had come to town. Just as Steve had said you would, and the guy who’d arranged that bar had been thrown out of a window.”      And there in Samui is where she’d stayed. Now not only worried about her husband but me also. The girl terrified that after the silver foxes demise, she would be next. Until she’d seen me in Samui and took me for just another loser at the bar.       Yes she’d known May and her brother Le, she’d told me. Meeting them both when they were just two frightened little boys, along with her and her brother and the others on that boat. And hearing this I’d stopped her in her tracks. 	“You mean, you first met them as brother and sister on the boat?”Sherri looking to me almost as confused as I was, as she heard the question I’d asked.	“No, two brothers. But you knew that right? She told you, first night when you met her, she told me that?”	“She’s got a kid” I said again, once more trying to justify my own ignorance.	“Men have children too.” Sherri said straight back in surprise. The girl using the same line as Steve had used on me the last time I’d bought up the child as defence. Maybe the guys not so stupid after all, and I’m the stupid one. Then Sherri carried on, telling me. “She got her boyfriend pregnant when they were teens. He’s done well now though, works for a law firm. Him and his wife live in Bangkok and have the kid.Now I was confused. I said.	“Oh?”	“Yes, it happens sometimes, you get role reversals, ladyboys with tomboys, but it rarely works out as it gets messy. No doubt? Then, hating the question I asked to be sure. 	“So May’s a… guy?”	“No, May was a ladyboy, like Le, but she’s all woman now. She’s had vaginoplasty surgery. Only someone with a gynecological degree could tell the difference.”	“Oh,” I said again, not knowing what the fuck that was and remembering myself eating lunch in the shower only the night before. 	“Le will never have that done though, that girl loves fucking straight guys too much.”	“Okay,” I said as I swallowed hard and looked to my boots still trying to make sense of it all. Then looking to Sherri, I said, unconsciously observing her breasts as I did.  	“So are you?”	“Oh, I’m all women. One hundred percent - all woman.” Replied Sherri with pride. Before carrying on and saying. 	“It’s hard though these days with girls like that about. I mean they make me feel ugly, and I know I’m not. But they still do. That’s what I was so upset with May about when I came over to your place at the beach on Samui. I mean, she had her sights set on you from the moment you arrived in town and started asking about Steve. I mean, same as Steve, guys like you two are rare here and like I said I’d heard all about you when Steve and I were together. And don’t kid yourself that it was just some coincidence she came to Samui to work.” Sherri said with a smirk, “You think May’s going to fly to Samui and hold up round boards for some nonsense fight when she can model for real money in Bangkok? She was there to stop some other girl getting her hooks into you. We both knew that.”	“Oh,” I said again. But then as I looked at Sherri I could see there was a lot more she wanted to say about this girl and before I could begin to think about how I could coax it out of her she started to spill the beans. 	“Not that she needs to work in modelling that much.” And like the naïve fool I was I answered for her and said.	“Yeah she gets the restaurant money and the tips from that show.”	“No!” Sherri then said back to me as she looked at me like a child. Her voice in shock.	“You think that if you want? You think that working as a restaurant greeter and getting photo tips at a ladyboy cabaret earns enough to pay for nails like hers? Or that new motorbike and all those designer clothes she wears. No… Boyfriends paid for that. Boyfriends paid for the language school for her and Le as well. The restaurant and the cabaret, that’s where she meets these guys who come into town and fall in love with her. And then send her money every week thinking that one day she’ll be their bride. I’d say she must have about twenty suckers out there dreaming the same dream.”Fuck me, did I feel like a fool?	“That’s a lot of buffalo?” I then said, Sherri smiling and saying straight back.        “No, that girls way ahead of any of that Issan farm girl nonsense. The girls high end, high level.”      “She never asked me for money once.” I then said, still confused as I felt the remaining walls of this world I thought I lived in come tumbling down. And all I heard Sherri say back was.      “No - she hasn’t asked you for money - yet.”            					***************So there it was, spelled out for me in black and white. I’d been played, or more likely I was about to be played. But no, Sherri, this girl who for pretty much as long as I had known her name I’d seen in my mind only a scam queen. Yet the girl had travelled all across town looking for me so as I could retrieve my money and save my ass from being scammed. I said as I looked at her in shock whilst she sat there with her face towards the crimson remnants of the setting sun.	      “I thought you were the cunt.” The girl turning and looking to me in shock as those words tumbled from my mouth. 	“You thought I was the same as them? Well I guessed as much after you’d come into that bar in Samui. And saw me with Johnny two girls.”      And that’s what they called him, Sherri had told me later, this man in his nineties who always had two girls on his arm. One for him and the other for his best friend who’d died from a brain tumour when they were just boys. Johnny telling his best friend he’d known since he was six as the young man had lay in his hospital bed sixty years before. Both of them knowing that soon the boys time would be up. 	“Know that I’m going to live a life worth living and know that every second girl I fuck will be for you.” And that is exactly what he’d done. I said back, and for as honest as this girl had been with me I did not want to lie, so I said. 	“So which one of the two used to fuck you. The dead one or Johnny two girls?”	      “Well, I suppose you would think that.” Said Sherri as she took a deep breath. “I mean what else could you have thought? Seeing me there in that slutty outfit and big heels. But like I tried to tell you before. That’s not me. It’s just a means to an ends. I have a plan. I didn’t put myself through English college so I could talk to losers in some bar. I’m Twenty two and by the time I’m twenty six I will have bathed away all this dirt from my body and I’ll be living in a western country either under my own steam or by marriage to the ‘right’ person and I can tell you I genuinely believed for a while that this person was your Steve.” I said as I took in all the girl had to say and wondered if she would ever stop talking. 	“Well let’s hope whoever you end up marrying, gets a pair of earplugs for Christmas.” 					***************      I walked back and ignoring the calls and texts from May on my phone as I headed through the now endless line of freelance ladies towards the hotel. Hearing trumpets and the fast paced drums of African music blaring out from one of the rooms in the area around the pool once I’d arrived. Feeling the vibration from the rhythm shake the wood of the door to my room. I stood there for the moment wondering what the fuck was going on now. Then without a knock which was probably never going to be heard anyway, I placed the room card into the slot and opened the door. Steve on the other side with his big cheeky grin. Standing there in the room just in his underpants along with the four African hookers I’d seen so many times standing in their spot on Walking Street. Jeering and teasing me as I’d pass so much that they now somehow seemed like friends.      The girls equally underdressed in their panties and bra’s. All of them dancing in the centre of the room to the music which blared out full blast from the TV speakers. The girls dancing well, Steve holding his own, with his elbows up under his armpits and his fists clenched. Dancing the way African men do. The young man running either hand in front of himself up and down and around and around as though he was a steam train. I stood there staring for the moment, then closing the door. I said.	“How you doing?” The girls recognizing me and answering straight back as they stood there dancing unashamedly naked before me.	“We – are - good, thank you.” They answered.Steve saying as he continued to dance in his tiny undies, as I walked to the TV and turned the music down.	“Girls are from Nairobi, they’re teaching me Swahili.”	“Looks like it.” I answered as I stared at the young man. “Ask them the word for penicillin or whatever shit they give you these days, then go get some because you’re going to need it.” Steve not giving a care, saying.	“Just dancing, being sociable, that’s all. Don’t need penicillin for that. You should try it.” And before I could say another word, one of the girls quite casually asked in the phonetically correct English she had learned at school. The women pronouncing every word and every letter of the fifth language she was fluent in perfectly. 	“You - are - more, than welcome, to, join us? I like, your, puppy, come, why do you not join us?”	“I’m okay thank you.” I replied as I looked at the girls, tempted by their lithe deep black skin and shapely bodies. 	“Your, friend, we have, worn him, out.” Said another girl as she smiled at me.	“I think, he, will need, a very good rest, after everything, that we will do, to him tonight”And with that I turned and left the room. Fuck me. I closed the door and stood with my back to it holding the little fella in my arms. His dick will be dropping off soon, As I heard the music turn back up, I then really started to worry for him with regard condoms and STD’s. I took the elevator and walked back outside and took a chair by the pool. The blue glow from the underwater lights lighting beneath the palms carefully positioned between the loungers.       The soft music drifting from the hotels small speakers drowned out by the bongo drums blasting out of the suite I’d rented. The balcony door now wide open as two of the girls made their way outside. Steve up there, dancing with the other two at the floor to ceiling window.       I thought back to the jilted and depressed Steve I’d just been in the company off up until he’d began this crusade that he’d recently started. The man seemingly completely unmindful of the fact I’d been to talk to this ex fiancé he’d been so besotted with.       And now, having met her and spent time with the young lady, I was sincerely not sure what to do. It seemed as though this Sherri was nothing but truthful and honest. The girl baring her soul to me the way she had. She’d had a tough go of it so far and was strong enough it seemed to fight her way out the other side. As had May and her sister or brother or whatever pronoun you’d use these days. All three of them living off their looks one way or another it seemed. But how many lizard skinned housewives previously married to oil executives had I met in my day. Most of them now divorced and living in million dollar mansions on fuck you spousal support. So was May any different if she had men supporting her? Not really. But she ‘d tried to play me. So the girl, if that is what she was, was now history.       And that was just the way it had to be.       Holiday romance or not, I had to admit it certainly did pain me. That weird overwhelming emotional tightness that you feel not only in your mind but physically in your stomach and chest and arms. I’d be lying if I said different. The fact she was a man or had been, taking the sting out of it all somewhat though. For as long as it had lasted I’d liked the attention. Craved it almost. But fuck me where could it go now? The girl was a guy. A pretty one nonetheless, I had to admit. Sherri though, was not and yeah, although blinkered at first. I could now see the appeal. 	She’d told me straight as we’d sat there on the beach. Eating our chicken on skewers and drinking our coconut milk from husks and whatever else had taken our fancy out there all afternoon and long into the evening. The money the husband had taken from her account could be found in his mother’s bed. That and what other money he’d scammed. So now all I’d had to do was wait. Wait until the mother dropped dead. Then either in the confusion or during the funeral I could sneak in and take it back. The only problem being was that she was sure her husband had similar designs. So even though the funeral would last all week, I had to be there ready and waiting for the women to croak, and that would take planning. 	I looked back up to Steve in our suite. The guy now wearing sunglasses and up behind one of the girls. Taking her sexually from behind as she leant against the window. Another girl waiting for him to move on to her so as he could do the same. The hotel manager there now standing on the other side of the pool looking up at him. Hearing the bongos blast and watching as Steve switched women, fucking the other girl from behind. The manager seeing me and walking over with his ass cheeks clenched in his tidy shirt and pants. As soon as he arrived he said,       “Sir  - You need to turn your music down.” Myself saying straight back as I looked up at the man from my lounge chair.      “Do I look like his dad?” The hotel manager immediately showing discomfort at the sight of my missing teeth.      “The suite’s booked under your name.” He said as he looked up again at Steve going at it.       “I thought you guys bought into the rock and roll life style? Tell me that the people who wore those suits you got in the lobby never took the stereo to eleven when they got it on?” I replied, talking complete nonsense. The man who was doing his best to look hip and trendy and so obviously from LA. Taking a deep breath and then calculating his answer, the manager said.      “It is yes, but, we have other guests to consider.” I said again,       “If my brother had a hit song you’d be asking for his jacket.”      “We have policy….” The man began saying, but I had already heard enough and was no longer interested in his words. So being the diplomat I am, I simply said.       “Go fuck off and work at Disneyland if you don’t like music.” And with that I watched him take a deep indignant breath and leave. The man’s ass cheeks even more clenched as he disappeared inside. I looked to Steve. The prick now just standing there naked at the window as the girls he’d just been fucking joined their friends lighting up there smokes on the balcony. All playing with their phones. Looking around I then saw May standing there on the other side of the pool looking straight at me.             					**************	She’d been there a while she said. Waiting and watching, trying to work up the courage to come over and talk whilst I’d sat alone and watched Steve and his new found friends. Then she said.	“I called and texted?” I looked to the girl seeing she was visibly upset. Oh, here we go!What good would it do to go over it all with her, explain what I felt? What good would it do to bring up these other guys who were stupid enough to be sending her money. It was none of my business now. There was no point, What was done was done and there was no point in saying one word about these other men she had on the go. So keeping it simple, I said.	“Go chat with one of the other fuck heads you string along if you can’t reach me.” Then I looked back up at Steve. The fool now standing outside on the balcony. 	“Sorry I don’t understand, who should I talk to - why would you say that?” May then said, the girl in obvious distress. But I didn’t bother to answer. What was the point? Nothing good was going to float out of my mouth and I needed to be civil. So for once I stayed quiet, then said.	“And you’re snatch’s not real.”	“What are you talking about Sandy?” She asked again. “What are you saying? What’s a snatch? Please I don’t understand. One minute we were making love. The next you’re telling me to go? What happened, when you went to the lobby?” I looked at her, or him, or whatever,  I suppose I should say. If someone was giving out awards for acting then May was worthy of an Oscar, for the girl seemed to genuinely have no clue. So I asked. 	“How long have you known this Sherri girl?”And in hearing these words, it seemed that everything in May’s world fell into one place. 	“So it was her?” She asked, already knowing the answer. “She’s the cause of this?”  	“You tell me?” I said, then looking up to Steve for a moment, I followed up with.	“You haven’t answered my question about this Sherri girl?”	“When we were kids – I knew her then, but she is not a friend.”	“And how many other cunt chops like me you playing?”	“I’m sorry?” May asked back. “What do you mean, I’m playing?”	“How many losers send you money?”May sat there looking to the pool for a moment, then to Steve up on the balcony. The guy now pacing naked like a Rockstar in his sunglasses behind the African ladies. Ignoring it, May said. 	“Sandy I’m sorry but you are not my first boyfriend. I have had others.”	“They send you money?” I asked.	“They have, yes in the past but I’m not attached to these men. I’m not stringing them along telling them that one day we will marry. If that’s what you’re asking?” It was indeed. But who was I to judge these people I’d never met. Say nothing, say nothing….So I said.	“Fucking losers wankers.”       The little fella laying on my lap, the most beautiful girl I’d ever met in my life in complete turmoil beside me. My brother naked up on the balcony of our suite re mounting the first of the four African prostitutes. All half naked leaning themselves up against the railing. May saying,	“Has Sherri told you I’m doing something bad? Please tell me?”For once, I said nothing. Just watched. Steve up there, the guy oblivious to all around, and  especially the drama that was unfolding beneath him. The young man playing rock star. Lost in his own little world of carnal fortitude. The guy fucking for a bit, then switching to the next girl to do the same, then moving on to the next whilst the girls played with their phones. May saying, 	“She’s told you I’m a ladyboy, hasn’t she?”She had. But what was the point of answering that question. So deciding to keep quiet and I said, 	“Yes.”May saying straight back to me as soon as she heard the answer and saw the truth written across my face. Myself wondering how it would feel to have my dick and balls cut off. But that wasn’t the question one could ask. 	“What’s if feel like to have your dick cut off?” I asked.	“That’s not fair, that’s just so wrong.” May said as she sat herself back in her chair and I cussed myself inside. Taking a deep breath, she then said angrily. 	“I’m sorry but after what you did to me yesterday evening in the bathroom. Then unless you really are a moron with entirely no understanding of a women’s reproductive organs, then you’d know that is just not true.” I guess then I’m a moron, And a bigger one than Steve, as he didn’t seem to be having the same trouble understanding the anatomy of women. Which I was having at the moment. Far from it. I looked to the other side of the pool to a crowd that had begun to build and then to the manager as he came marching his way out of the door and taking one look upwards headed straight back inside again.       Taking another deep breath May carried on.	“Yes I knew – we knew Sherri when we were young. And it’s a time in both Le and my young lives that is something I’d not like to discuss. We did not see her again for many years and when we did I was sad to see that she and her go-go dancing brother had not escaped that world as we had. I did know about you because Sherri had told Le that this fantastic guy she was seeing had asked her to marry him, and he had a wonderful brother. Then I heard that some money was missing and Sherri had ran away, which pained me. I then met you and realised who you were and I kept quiet about knowing about Sherri, because firstly, what happened to Le and me as children is about us, and… like I say, I just don’t want to go there ever again. And secondly, I did not want you to think we were involved in this missing money. You are obviously not the first boyfriend I’ve ever had, but I had hoped that maybe you were going to be the last. I’ve never been interested in any other men since we met despite the attention I get. I do have friends and I’ll say it again. They have sent money to me – yes - But they are ex boyfriends who are still in love with me. But I – I - no longer have feelings for them.” May said as she held her hands pumping them into her chest as she spoke, “and ‘I’ do not string them along, telling them I’ve a sick buffalo or any other bullshit game that perhaps this girl has told you I do. Yes - it was wrong to let Le get involved with your brother, but in Samui seeing the way that Sherri was carrying on openly with another guy I believed Steve was now available. I have no doubts now that she has probably told you that we took the fight gig purposely because you two would be there and that’s true. That is true… I did it though and I told Sherri this because I did not want any other women coming for you.”      I’d like to say that I had not heard a word May had said as she came to the end of her long, long, emotional crisis speech. But I had listened to every clear and precise university educated word the girl had said. Despite the distraction of watching, as she had delivered it, the hotel manager and two security guards burst out onto our suites balcony and haul Steve away. Then throw towels over the girls bodies, before escorting them all out the door. So with that, all I said back was.      “So you don’t have a dick then?” And May replied.	“No Sandy I have produced a child - I have a womb - I have a womb.”And as far as I was concerned that had to be the truth. Because although maybe as mentioned I didn’t have an encyclopedic knowledge of a women’s reproductive system or the gynecological degree necessary to spot such a thing. What I did know, for certain, from my limited experience so far in this world. Is that only a women would be capable of making such long, clear and precise speech as the one I’d just heard, at the same time as some guy was fucking four hookers from behind above them on a fourth floor balcony. It simply wasn’t in a man’s DNA. So that was that – job done – case proven. Why Sherri, had gone to such length to feed me full of bullshit, I don’t know. Jealousy possibly. Maybe she was after me for herself since she seemed to like hanging around people who could look after themselves, so to speak. Not that Steve couldn’t. But Steve was wild, and off on his own personal crusade it seemed and the hotel manager in his soft loafer shoes could attest to that.         We sat there, the pair of us not speaking for what seemed an age. May in her skinny jeans and high heels with her feet up on the lounger ordering and paying for a beer for me and despite never usually touching alcohol, a cocktail for herself. The warm yet cooling breeze rustling the palm leaves above us. The live sex show playing from a certain fourth floor suite now concluded. Myself sitting in silence with no teeth in my big boots and cut off shorts. I wondered about the hotel manager and what would be the outcome of the ‘African bongo party’ Steve had decided to hold, and the answer to that question came not too long after. Because, as soon as the man saw May and I heading up to the suite we were shown our belonging all neatly packaged up and invited to leave.       But this was not due to the noise or the sex show Steve had given to anyone who’d cared to look up to the fourth floor would see, as truthfully that was the sugar coated image the hotel was perhaps trying to project. The problem was because, as Steve’s four girlfriends had left, Steve had decided to follow them in his underpants and on the way out the door he’d managed to somehow snag and put on Elvis’s golden jacket.      And out the door with it he’d gone, piling into a waiting taxi with the four African hookers. Ignoring the receptionists protests as he’d sat there glistening in the back seat. And it was in the centre of the dance floor of the Marine disco where he’d been found. His African friends long forgotten and back at their usual hustle spot on Walking Street, as Steve moved about the glowing surface of the dance floor, surrounded by Russian women. Busting Elvis move after Elvis move until the police came.             			      Chapter Twelve                   I sat with May and the little fella this time in the police station reception. Us on one side and the hotel manager along with a security guard on the other. The man looking exhausted in his soft leather shoes. The rear door to the inside of the police station opened, and Soone Jungumang appeared followed by Steve. The man still drunk, in his underpants, sunglasses, and wearing Elvis’s gold sequined jacket on his back. With great reluctance Steve slowly took it off and Soone handed it to the manager. Steve saying as he stood there lifting his sunglasses and showing his bloodshot blurry eyes to the hotel manager,       “Rock and roll baby! Rock and roll.” Myself saying to the man straight after.	“I bet Presley never had as much fun wearing that!”Then as the man checked the jacket he looked to Steve and said.	“You know this is priceless right? Elvis Presley’s isn’t just handing out jackets and tickets to his show these days you know?” Steve saying straight back.	“Go tell that to Pastor Bob’s congregation in Arkansas, they may beg to differ.”And with that, the hotel manager and his security left the building. Steve looking to me, said,	“since Elvis was always known for being generous I just done a deal here with Mr. Soone and bought back that car back you loved. He did not want to sell it but I know how much you missed it.”					***************      We dropped off May at her condo and getting out she moved in close and kissed me on the lips. Then asked, 	“We good?”Were we? It was a good question. May then saying as she held both my hands and smiled as she looked up at me.	“Call me okay, let me know where you are staying.” Myself saying “sure.” But deep down knowing I never would. For as much as the beautiful girl had spoken at great length protesting her innocence without seemingly taking a breath of air. There was one thing that was bothering me and it was that she’d pretended it was Sherri that had sent me to the Mekong. However warranted she’d felt in doing so.      I climbed back in and squeezed myself once again into the bucket seats of the little noisy Honda, and pulling away I heard Steve say. The man rolling his head around and around, still drunk.	“I thought you’d dropped that?”I had. Then Steve asked as I heard the engine roar.       “I thought you’d be upset about it so bought you some color to lighten your mood.”	“I saw.”Steve looked out the window. The guy sitting there beside me, still in his underpants. I said.	“We got a life time ban from that hotel?”	“they wouldn’t have done that to Elvis, he done that?” Steve replied as he put his shades back on.	“You’re not Elvis.” I said as I pulled the car up on to the toll road which headed back towards Bangkok.	“I was last night.” Steve said with a grin, “I was last night - baby...”				****************It was almost mid-afternoon when Steve woke up in the front seat of the car. The man for a moment no clue as to where he was. Confused he looked about and then to the road signs which we’d passed only a few days before. Looking to me he said.	“I just had this crazy dream.”	“Oh yeah?”	“yeah – I was Elvis Presley and I went to Africa.”	“That was no dream.” I said as I felt another of the many potholes that had already shaken the life out of the hard suspension of the car. Then Steve looked to the seats and around the interior of the car then seeing the new back scratcher on the dash, Soone must have bought due to having the same issue with the seats. Picking it up and putting it to work, he said.	“We been in a time machine or something?”	“Yeah we’re looking for your ex.” I said back without missing a beat. Then Steve looked down and realized he was only wearing his underpants. 	“Where’s my clothes.”	At the next town I stopped at a Big C and bought him some surf shorts and flip flops along with a T - shirt that read in English. ‘Loser’ on its front. Looking to the shirts logo, Steve said, “That’s you, that is. Not me.Is that right?Then he asked as he slipped the shirt over his head. 	“Is that all they had?” He asked. It wasn’t, but it was worth it. 	“In your size, yeah,” Then I said after he’d wore it for the rest of the day.	“Your clothes are in the trunk. The hotel packed them for you.”	“That’s nice.” He replied. Then he said, 	“My dicks itching.”	“Probably that Sherri,” I replied as I kept my eye on the road as the trucks whizzed past us. Steve thought about that one. Then said, 	“Nah. She’ll be giving any bugs she got to you now I think.”					***************Just as the sun was about to set we pulled off the highway and headed the short journey to the coast. Ten minutes later we were at a resort. Steve getting out and stretching as I did the same. The little fella jumping to the ground. Looking about at the reception, Steve said. 	“looks like the same place we stayed before.” It was, but it wasn’t the beach I was here for. It was a certain person who lived on this same beach. A someone who used to own a Pitbull which had drowned. 					***************	We checked into the room, taking the exact one we had the time before we’d been there. Steve walking about looking more and more confused as he pulled on his itchy dick. Myself saying.	“Clean the fucking thing for god’s sake.”Then I was out walking along the beach with the puppy towards the same area where I’d first met the Little Fella. The group of Pitbull’s still there on the beach. Minus one. The little beagle with them, looking as cute as ever. The Thai dog yapping in the same manner it had the last time I’d walked the shoreline. The dog’s owner with his white pasty skin despite the heat standing in the garden watering the plants with his hose. 	Walking straight up to the gate that led out onto the sand and ignoring the protests from the dogs, I entered the garden as the man watched me walk towards him. His hose overfilling a plant pot as he did. Reaching him, I said. 	“Okay, now say to my face what you told the police.”The man standing there staring up at me, looking to my missing teeth. I said it again.	“Tell me how I killed your little dog who was just playing.”The man, standing there with his hose pipe running as he nervously swept his free hand around his head and neck. Then he said,	“It wasn’t me?”	“It wasn’t you?” I said straight back.	“No.” It was - the lying prick. I asked again.	“Tell the truth. Last chance.” The man looking to me with fear in his eyes. Then in a panic he quickly said. 	“Yes I called them, I called them and straight after regretted it as I had a feeling you’d come calling.” 	“Well you were right about that, what you tell them?”	“Told them my dog was playing and you drowned it.”	“Tell me how all these teeth marks got into the leather of these boots then?”The man stood there staring at my feet, at these boots that had of late seen so much action. Then just as I was contemplating head butting the man he said, 	“I’m sorry.”I stared at him, suddenly caught in limbo. Looking to see if the apology was genuine or as phoney as a shiny Rolex you’d pick up at Bangkok’s Patpong night market. Then he said it again and I could see the sincerity in his eyes.  	“I’m sorry, I am, I’m sorry. That was the old me, the man I used to be, from years ago. When I was a bad person. When I’d been the president of a home owners association until I saw the light as to exactly the individual I’d become. So I came here to leave that all behind, be a better person. But I let that slip when I let that vicious dog I’d bought run riot.”       The man obviously carrying a lot of baggage. God knows what other bullshit he’d pushed under the wood pile. He had seen the error of his ways though. ‘Credit to where credits due’ as they say. So trying to put his mind at ease I said.	“Yeah. Once a cunt always a cunt.”With a smile and doing his best to ignore that one, he reached out and stroked the little fella’s neck. Then asked,	“Is this the puppy you saved?”It was. 	“Good, good for you.” The man said with a smile even though I had not said a word. “He’d be dead if you had not been around - It’s fate.” Then he looked at my mouth and my missing teeth. 	“I’m sorry for your injury – did this happen after?”Indeed it did. The man carrying on saying,	“when I pulled the dog that drowned, Zues was his name, from the water I saw his front teeth were missing also. So no doubt you did that? That’ll be Karma. I’m sorry. I could have stopped this had I been responsible. It is my fault. I knew Zues was a mean one. I should have taken the dog to the temple.”His fault? I don’t think so. I’d called that kick boxing wanna be out? Called the guy a cunt. So in the spirit of things I said. 	“You lucky you still got yours.”	“Oh,” the man answered as I saw him unconsciously wipe his front teeth with his tongue. The man, a fellow Canadian from Ontario, in his sixties, standing there, with his pasty face and paunchy gut. Shaking his head slowly from side to side. 	“I need to try harder.”I walked back to the hotel room that overlooked the beach which we’d returned to. The little fella following, playing with the waves as they threw themselves one by one across the white sand. Steve saying as soon as I we arrived back. 	“Come on we need to get going?”	“Where to?” I asked. 	“Anywhere but here.”But we weren’t going anywhere for a while. As we were waiting for someone to die. 					****************      So there we sat for the next couple of days. Myself taking it easy. Swimming in the pool and riding the surf in the ocean. Ignoring calls from May and taking them from Sherri. The girl talking for an age as some girls can. Steve complaining about his itchy dick and again warning me that I’d have one too soon, if I kept talking to that whore. Myself reminding the man that not to long ago she was to be his wife. My brother replying.	“Till I saw the light.”	“met a girl with a dick, more like.”	“You can talk?”	“Mine had a womb, she showed it to me.” I said, knowing that even with my imperfect medical or scientific knowledge that was an impossibility.	“Oh yeah, I forgot they keep an ultra sound machine by the kettle in hotel rooms here.”       And so it went, endless bullshit banter between two brothers as our days melted away in the sun. The man who once owned a vicious Pitbull popping in more often than he should. Bringing cold beers and food his wife had made. The man retiring to this sleepy shoreline in the hope of finding redemption for his malignant past. Marrying a Thai lady half his age, who Steve now coveted. The lady with her low cut blouses, big eyes and tight shorts. The man sinking deep into a religion that for ninety percent of his life previously he’d only known as a word. The gentleman now quoting buddha as easily as he could hockey stats. Steve asking if there was any ladyboy bars close by. 	“Not here,” The ex-housing association president turned Buddhist who went by the name a Campbell had answered as his eyes had queried my brothers openness. Steve sensing the man’s discomfort, carrying on saying.	“Yeah, my brother has a thing for them.”	“Oh,” Campbell had said as he looked to me and then to the floor. 	“Yeah, they like him cos he’s got no teeth.”The man surprising us both for once by shutting Steve down in an instance, saying.	“Yeah, well I had sex with one once too. Real hot she was, that’s not for me though. You know why?” he asked. Then carried on straight away without waiting for a reply with,	“Never sleep with a women who can beat you in an arm wrestling match.”Well that wasn’t that untrue, The way May’s sister had demolished that ginger haired fighter who’d sucker punched her in Samui. The man actually in the end, turning out to be pretty good company, even if he had once called the cops on me. Had he not though, maybe I’d have never met that cop and there’d be a boat still full of Christians floating on the Mekong and a guy in a Tuk Tuk flitting about in Vientiane advertising his wares with a little green flag. There was that one guy out there still though and I knew from the long telephone calls I’d been taking from Sherri that it wouldn’t be long before we met again. The girl laughing down the phone after I’d told her May’s reaction to me accusing her of being a ladyboy. The girl saying straight after. 	“what do you guys say over there that they taught me in my English class at school – All’s good in love and war?”  Steve saying each time I’d hang up the phone something like.	“Remember where that mouths been when you kiss her. But I honestly did not think he cared. The man telling me his new philosophy being that he pays up front instead of paying more on the back end. If it floats, flies or fucks – rent it. That old cliched chestnut. Not that he’d been paying for anything since I’d arrived and had been picking up the bills. But what was new there. 	Then as one night seemed to drift into the next and Steve had seemed to have perfected the art of body surfing in the waves, Sherri called again and this time told me to get ready. 					******************The place her husband’s family lived backed onto a small irrigation canal she’d told me.       “I’m not in the house, I’m outside as his mother hates me and I’m no longer welcome.”      “Why?” I’d asked knowing that it was none of my business.      “She thinks I’m no good for him.” Was all Sherri said.       No good for her son who deals in child sex trafficking.	      “She know what her son does for a living?” I asked. 	“She drove the van.” Sherri said straight back with contempt.What a nasty bitch, That’s if what Sherri was saying about her mother in-law was the truth, and I already knew the girl had been known to stretch that.       “My husband would be inside though.” She’d said.      Her husband. The guy with her, holding her hand, trusting her, pimping her out to western men to scam. Some husband - no wonder she was royally chatting me.Then with a ping, a picture arrived on my phone showing the house from the front above and from across the other side of the canal. 	“Get ready.” she said,  “They’ll all be messed up when that witch dies and gets taken to the temple. Park up the road and cross the canal, you may have to wade it, or swim, depending on the weather. The money will be in a slot cut into the side of the mattress that rests against the wall. Her bedroom is the only one in the house with its own buddha shrine. The woman has paid her way to high social status, so it’ll get busy quick. People are already arriving from all over.”      So leaving Steve alone with the dog and the opportunity to make more suggestive glances and comments to Campbells wife I left armed only with an address and a few photos taken from a digital map. 	The place was a good ten miles away. Reaching it I passed by the back of the house. Then I found a bridge across the canal at its rear and thankful now for the blacked out windows, I passed by the front of the house in my noisy car. It was obvious something was going on. The long line of other cars haphazardly parked along the road. The groups of people standing, looking mournful, as their children played and the street dogs wandered nervously around them all. Sherri in her nice western clothes standing out like a princess amongst them all.So she was correct,  I drove past her and wondered if she knew it was me inside driving the car. Looking to her lengthy dyed hair and red lips as I went. I carried on along the road until I reached another worn down bridge and crossed to the other side. Pulling up I stared out at the canal with its black water and grime that floated upon its surface. I looked to the clock on the dashboard of the car. It was now five thirty in the afternoon. The sun would be setting soon. 	I drove by the back of the house one more time and parked up along the road. Looking about I could see there was no one around. Then I waited, staring at my phone. An hour later it rang and it was Sherri, who coldly just said. 	“She’s just died.” I looked down the canal to where the house sat. Staring at the homes roof almost as though I expected this woman I’d never known to come floating out through the roof tiles. Then I heard Sherri say.       “I’ll let you know when they start to move the body.”  Opening the door, I stepped out and almost as soon as I’d taken two paces forward a street dog was on me. The mutt doing its best to look tough with its haunches up and yapping. Picking up a stick I quickly sent it on its way and slipping down onto the bank I dropped myself into the water and disappeared quickly under. The dog standing up on the road, barking as I re surfaced and swam myself to the other side. Then grabbing handfuls of weed, I pulled myself along the bank, passing the back wall of the other houses until I reached the one owned by the husbands family. 	With the noise of the dog still barking in my ears, I climbed out and looked at my bare legs in the twilight. Leaches large and small now hung beneath my knees like tiny miniature eels. Reaching down I pulled the first one off, picking away the grip it held upon my skin with my finger nails. Feeling the slimy wet body squish beneath my fingers. The little thing holding on with its tiny teeth as long as it could. Reluctant to give up it’s free lunch or allow itself to be ripped in two. Pulling them all off  I climbed the canal bank. My big boots once again full of water as my toes slipped about inside. Their tread digging into the mire as I pushed my way up the muddy slope.       Reaching the top I sneaked a look over the wall built just a few inches higher than the bank on the other side for when the rains came and burst it’s banks, flooding the land on the other side where the dog now stood, now joined by another. Both now barking as loud as the air in their lungs would allow. 	Reaching the rear door, I then waited. The inside of the house now as silent as an empty church. Stepping inside I made my way down a thin corridor then looked to the left into a small empty room as the sweet caustic and unmistakable smell of lingering death hit me. Stopping I looked along the corridor. The door to the room on the right was fully open. I moved forward, feeling the water in my boots again squishing around my toes. The smell becoming stronger as I neared the open door before stopping outside to look into the room that Sherri had described as her mother in-laws bedroom. And that’s where I saw him again for the third time.       The husband, with his long hair and his fancy jeans. Leaning over his mothers bed. Close to the Buddhist shrine just as the man’s wife had told me her mother-in-law used for worship. The man pulling away at his recently departed mothers mattress, and finding nothing. The fabric still warm from her body. The sheets smelling of her piss. Then sensing someone was behind him, the husband suddenly turned. The man’s knees buckling from beneath him as he saw me standing there. Dripping wet in my clothes, smiling at him with no teeth to show, and with the leeches I’d yet to find hanging from my skin. Then before he could run like the cornered rat he was, I spartan kicked him hard in the chest and sent him flying back off of his feet into the shrine that this family had no right to keep. 	With a thump he hit the floor as the candles and pictures of Ajahn Phra TaSol,the one hundred plus year old monk so revered in these parts fell to the ground. The husband gasping for air as he tried to stand. Then before he could re gain his composure I was back on him. Slipping him quickly into a choke hold that would be impossible to escape I dragged him quietly from the room and back down the corridor. With the sound of the man’s jeans ripping away as the jagged cement wall dug into the skin on the backs of his calves, I pulled his body down the muddy bank into the water of the murky canal.	With the dogs barking ringing in my ears and feeling the canal bed beneath my feet I pulled the man’s body through the water until I reached the other side. How long had it been?I’d clasped him in the chokehold and dragged him through the house and into the canal? Not long, I’d been quick. Ten maybe twelve seconds? The man would be out soon if he wasn’t already. Then once he was unconscious, I’d simply just let him go. Let him drop down into the water to drown in the way he deserved. 	And just as I was about to let go of his body to do just that, I heard the dogs stop barking and felt one bite me on the arm. The street dog snarling and ripping at my flesh as the other rightly so, joined in the attack.       “Fuck!” I said out loud as I felt the both animals teeth ripping into the skin at the top of my arm. Their strong rancid jaws clamping on to me as they twisted and turned their necks. Letting go of the husband, I reached around with my free hand and punched both dogs hard in the face. Then, when the pain of my fists did not make them release, I grabbed each ones face. One at a time, poking my index finger deep into their eye sockets until they did. 	The dogs yelping as the pain of them losing an eye each became a shocking sudden reality. Then ignoring the blood as it ran from the bites in my left arm and getting back to business, I looked down to see the husband was gone. 	Stepping forward, I reached down with my right arm and felt through the dark water feeling only reeds and small debris as I swished about feeling for his body.  Then out of the corner of my eye I saw him, maybe twenty feet along the canal, as he scrambled up the bank on all fours and disappear into the rear of a neighbouring home. Fuck me, this man was like a fucking cat with nine lives. And so far he’d used up three.   					****************I made it back to the hotel and walked inside through the patio doors and went straight to the bathroom. Hearing Steve say as I turned on the tap and looked to the bites on my left arm. 	“Who’s dead this time?”No one sadly. And wasn’t that the truth. Then I asked him, 	“Why do you always say shit like that?” Not bothering to answer Steve said instead. 	“I just tried to fuck that guys missus but her husband’s not having it. Guys man marking her like he owns the woman.”For fuck sake, does he ever stop? 	‘they are married.” I told him as I looked at the bites. 	“Guy should share it about you know. Needs to learn not to be selfish if he wants to improve who he is like he keeps saying.”	“The man brings you beer, what’s wrong with you do you have no morals.” I said as I looked in the bathroom mirror.	“should give some to her, loosen her up a bit.”I’ll ignore that, So I said out loud.       “you’re a fucking bigot.” Then I looked back at the bites. They were deep and sore, but I’d had worse. Calling out, I asked.	“You got any scotch or shit left here?”Hearing Steve grown as he pulled himself off a chair and away from his phone saying. 	“Yeah, a bit. But I was going to save some cos there’s a bunch of foreign beach cleaning do good students coming round here soon.”Then seeing his face as he entered the bathroom as his eyes widening in alarm went straight to the bites on my arm. He said. 	“Jesus fuck Christ.”Then he saw the leeches, that I’d yet to find an remove.      “What the fuck have you been doing?” As he then opened the bottle of scotch and took a swig before dropping a little bit of alcohol on each leech removing them one by one as he spoke.      “See this on a movie once.” He said, as he pulled each one off and threw them in the toilet. But I knew he hadn’t ‘seen it in a movie’. Because, as I mentioned before, this wasn’t our first canoe trip into a river, or a canal or lake for that matter. They’d been a few and we’d both had our fair share of parasitic leeches over the years, in and out of the water.       “What is it with you and dogs?” He then asked looking at the bites as he moved in closer, for a moment putting his nurses uniform on.       I said nothing. Then as I felt the sting of the soap and water he sprayed into both wounds followed by the scotch, he said.	“I told you before you can forget about the money. I’ll go do a job and pay you off. Just stop this shit before you get yourself arrested or killed.”  	But it wasn’t about the money anymore, and I wasn’t stopping. There was no way. I’d seen the frightened faces of those kids on that boat and I’d heard the tales since from Sherri in our endless chats where I barely spoke. Anyone on that boat over the age of consent, as I said, had a problem and I wasn’t backing down. Most now were dead from natural causes and the last one would soon be sent him off to be with his mother and whatever god would accept their kind.    					****************	An hour later after a quick trip by Steve to the local 7-11, I was bandaged up and sitting on the bed with the little fella. The top of my arm now feeling sore and bruised and I was contemplating rabies shots at the local hospital. I had not heard from Sherri which was strange.       I slept rough, haunted by vivid dreams of dogs and leeches and a small shitty roach like Asian man who was difficult to exterminate. Then just before the  dawn light came bursting into this quiet section of the world my brother and I currently occupied, I’d woken with my T-shirt wet with sweat around my chest and my boots still on.  	Getting up I pulled my T-shirt from my body and walked outside with the little fella running at my heels. The sun painting the sky with its deep orange glow. Sitting down on the beach and resting my chin upon my knees I just sat and watched. Listening as the world around me slowly woke up. Birds chirping. Springing out from their nests or perches high above. Flying with pace and vigor out into the morning air. Racing their little wings as they twisted and turned in the dawn sky. The unrelenting surf rushing in as the waves emptied on the beach. Stretching themselves out as they did their best to touch the tips of my boots. 	That wonderful moment that touches us all at some point in our lives. That moment of tranquility. One minute of pure wonderment that finds you as you find it. A time when you realise it is just yourself alone with nature and you feel blessed as the warmth of the first rays of the morning sun grows and you’re bathed in its presence.	And there I sat, for once not feeling. For once not thinking, just being. The little fella laying there at my feet with his head in the sand as we both listen to the dawn. Then behind me, seeming out of nowhere I heard Steve say as he began to run his mouth off.	“You gotta love this, yeah you gotta love this, fuck, the peace, the tranquility, this is what it’s all about. This is life, this is living, this is what we all dream off. Both of us out here on our own - no one bothering us.”   I looked around to him, the man standing there in his underpants and said.      “Will you just fuck off?”      “Oh someone’s got out the wrong side of the bed. I wasn’t me who bit you. Why can’t you just enjoy what’s around you.”       And then as quick as my brother had dropped in and spoiled the moment - he was gone again. Leaving me there with the morning sun and a canvas of orange and purple to feast my spirits on. Then just as I had almost once again found that mystical feeling that had reached deep within me moments before, he was back. This time with my phone, ramming the thing in my face as he said.       “That bitch who stole your money’s on the line.”      Sherri asking straight off the bat with a manner void of any pleasantries.      “You kill him, is he in that canal? I’m scared to look.”      “I’ve never killed anyone.”      “I’m at the temple, he’s not here, he never showed.”      “He was at the house – maybe I spooked him.”      “That’s not good.” Is all Sherri said next. Then she stayed silent for a moment. Before saying.       “He may think I told you?”      “Who knows what he’s thinking.” I said back, before Sherri asked.      “You found your money though didn’t you?”I hadn’t. So I said. 	“I found him searching for it.”	“Okay.” Sherri then said, her voice loaded with nerves and tension. “I’m staying here at the temple, there’s a lot of people, I’ll not leave, I’ll sleep in the temple floor by that woman’s body. He won’t touch me here. Funerals last days, I’ll let you know if he shows.” And with that without giving me a chance to speak Sherri was gone. The girl moving fast, thinking faster, as she did her best to remove this malignant individual from her life. But what she was yet to realise as she sat there in this temple that morning. Feeling the same heat as I from the early morning sun, was that her husband was already there, and he was watching her.Chapter Thirteen       It wasn’t until the end of the next day when I heard from Sherri again. The girl just as frantic with her words. Her phone call once again interrupting a serene moment as I sat in the local clinic having the now infected bites on my upper arm dressed and rabies shots pumped into my arm. Steve there, grinning like an idiot at the young nurses all reveling in the attention. Sherri saying in complete panic. 	“He’s here, there’s hundreds of monks and he’s one of them.”	“How long has he been there?” I asked. 	“I don’t know, these monks, they’re everywhere. His mother’s gave all that cash you were looking for to the temple a week ago. I discovered that this afternoon when I heard it had now gone missing. Someone stole it. So I started looking at everyone, including the monks. I hadn’t looked at them before but I started once I heard that. Everyone’s wearing black and all the monks are in orange. It’s hard but I managed to work my way through everyone. That’s when I saw him.”	“He see you?” I asked wondering if she was ever going to stop.	“Of course.”	“he shave that hair?” Stupid question, And as soon as I had asked it, I heard Sherri say again.           “Of course.” And followed it up quickly with. “He was here as a kid, so he’ll know the routine.” Then pausing for a moment she said. “I knew he could never miss this, that old monk I asked for help, remember? He’s here as well now, the one you see all over the place on the back of the cars.”      “I saw him once in Samui.” I replied butting in, then trying to add something other than panic to the conversation, I said, “Guys still with us then?” But Sherri wasn’t listening. She said.      “Everyone is scattered now, but there’s a ceremony tonight at eight. Then the cremation is tomorrow morning now. Ajahn Phra TaSol decided that apparently. After that my husband, he’ll be gone again - until the next time he pops up out of nowhere to ruin me.”      And then without another word she was gone.       I sat there looking to the clock on the wall as the nurses did their thing. It was six in the evening. The temple was a good fifteen minutes away. By the time I was done here it would be about seven. Then I’d have an hour to drop these two off and get over there.       But like everything that you do around these parts, it takes time. And I wasn’t released until seven thirty. 					**************      What was worrying me the most as I drove through the country roads towards the temple was that if things got really bad and Steve became involved, then the little fella would be out on the street. And that couldn’t happen. I said.	“when we get there. You take a cab back okay?”	“get where?” 	“Temple.” I answered quickly as I saw the second sign pointing the way. The whole billboard emblazed in gold writing with a picture of Ajahn Phra TaSol, sitting centre place.	“Why?” Steve then asked.	“Sherri’s there.”	“For fuck sake.” Steve said simply. Ignoring him I continued saying.	“I’m going to meet a monk.”	“Not that old guy we keep seeing pictures of is it?” It wasn’t.	“No.” I answered without elaborating. Then I watched Steve, the man suddenly uncomfortable as he began to shift in his seat.	“You can never harm a monk, remember preaching that fucking little golden nugget to me, do you?” I did,But I wasn’t going anywhere to harm a monk, I was going there to harm an impostor.					*****************  	I pulled the car into the temple grounds, passing through its golden archway and parked up at the edge of the temples now crowded car park. The huge sacred space built for worship there before us, rising from the earth in all its worldly Buddhist grandeur. Large steps, as steep as they were wide, rising up towards magnificently coloured carved wooden doors that led within. Steve said as he looked at the steps that led up to the main door, “who’s this mob then?”“You don’t know?” I asked in genuine disbelief. He didn’t. So I asked him.“How long you been here in this country?”“Longer than you.” “Take a guess.” I asked. Steve saying straight back without missing a beat.“Buddhist.”“What makes you think that?” I asked just in case he’d got lucky with a wild guess.“Because it’s all that housing association nob whose missus needs to get fucked keeps talking about. It’s his second favourite subject, all he ever talks about - talks about that and his missus who I’m telling you is dying for it. And the fact that you kicked his dogs teeth out, then drowned it.”“He said that did he?”“Yeah said it’s a secret. Said he let it go because karma took care of that for him and you’d suffered enough with your teeth, said he’d have nothing to aim at when he hits you with one of them shaolin priest moves. Guy thinks he’s Caine out of Kung Fu. He was a Buddhist as well. But you probably don’t know important historical shit like that.”“You’re right. don’t know - before my time.” I said, as I looked up at the temple and wondered how long it would be before I found that shit head inside. Steve on a role, carrying on, saying straight back.“Yeah well that’s what you get for not bunking off school and watching cable in theafternoon like I did. Missed out on a proper education, staying there learning nonsense you don’t need, like the square root of a banana, being teacher’s pet and shit, Mr. goody two shoes, learning like you did.”“Is that right?” I said wondering when the guy was ever going to shut up. But no, my brother wasn’t done,      “Now he’s saying that dog that bit your arm name’s karma. But I doubt that’s true because your new girl told me they don’t name street dogs around here.” Looking to Steve I said.	“You need to go, take the little fella back to the hotel. I’ll see you later.”	“I want to come in, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about religion since I’ve been trying to fuck that guys wife.”Is that right? 	“You know what I think about all these religions around the world” Steve carried on saying, “I think that maybe all these people are worshipping the same guy - like these guys who marry loads of women - it’s all the same person just packaged different.” 	“what about Sikh’s, they got seven gods.” I answered straight back using some of the ‘nonsense’ I’d learned being ‘teacher’s pet’. Reaching out, my hand pulled the door latch open. Steve saying to me as I stepped out the car.       “well those Indian guys, they always go in for big families you know that?”                   				***************      	I walked to the bottom of the steps and looked up. The ornately carved roof with its dragons and curling points of spear, all laying silhouette against the moonlit clouds. I began to climb them quickly, taking two at a time. Counting twenty eight strides as I went. I reached the top to find myself standing in amongst a sea of shoes. Then looked back, Steve was still there.The fucking prick.  With the blacked out windows it was impossible to tell if either him or the puppy had watched me go or if they were watching me now? Probably. Silently I signalled him to go, motioning towards the road with my hands for him to leave. Once, then twice. Then I waited as nothing happened. The prick.Giving up, I turned and moved towards the door and stepped inside. The interior of the temple dimly lit and crowded with locals neatly lined up, all sitting barefoot on chairs. Most dressed in black, some with white shirts. One hundred plus Monks lined the length of one wall. All sitting on the backs of their legs, in their orange robes. Their shaved heads bowed in prayer.       A huge golden Buddha gracing all at the far end of the temple, watched with silent eyes from his raised platform stage. The husbands mother laying beneath him in her white coffin emblazoned in lavish silver patterns at his feet. The woman now surrounded by an array of flowers and portable circulars fans. Ajahn Phra TaSol there also. The man having seen it all before in his one hundred plus years. No doubt wishing it could be him instead laying at peace.       The man too old now to crouch as he had all his life. Seated in a chair before her. The man’s personal assistants in their orange robes to either side, all leading the chant of prayer on Ajahn Phra TaSol behalf as the revered monk stayed silent. 	I stood there watching it all from the back. Looking along the line of monks for the husband. Tall monks, short monks, skinny monks, fat monks. Some with orange satchels slung across their shoulders, others with tattoos, several with mobile phones laying close. This procession of holly men who’d converted to the Buddhist faith from all walks of life. All individual, although all looking the same. I then looked through the crowd of what must have been four hundred people and fidgety kids for Sherri. If she was there, I couldn’t tell.  	I looked down to the glazed white tile floor. My big boots outlandish amongst the bare feet of all around me. Then as quietly as I could, I started walking. Slowly looking to each monk, one at a time as I passed before them. None raising their heads as I passed. The husband there in amongst them for certain. Slowly, I passed ten, then twenty, then thirty, then fifty and sixty, staring at each individual as I went. The Buddhist chants harmonically singing in my ears as the repeated words I could not comprehend echoed around me. Then as I reached the end I turned my head towards the coffin laying silent in all its silver sparkling splendour. Ajahn Phra TaSol, the elder monk sitting beneath it with his head up and staring at me through his watery eyes. The man seemingly knowing who I was and why I was there. Then he changed his gaze. His head twisting slightly turning to his right as he looked a foot beyond me to a monk sitting behind where I now stood. 	Turning I stared at the man in his old robe with his worn out satchel across his shoulder. His face and head shaved. His small body. I moved closer, standing there as all around me continued with their chant. The man before me now doing the same, as he recited the ancient scripture. I looked to his face then to the amulet hanging around his neck, then to the monks hands. In this moment of tranquil prayer, this man’s hands which he clasped tightly together were trembling slightly. I then looked to his legs to see the scratches on the back of his calves that he would have gained if someone bigger had dragged him backwards over the wall towards a canal. Then I stared at his recently shaved head. Gone were his long greasy locks of hair I’d felt as I’d tried to choke him out. Gone was the drooping moustache I’d felt upon my wrist as he’d wriggled and snarled as he’d tried to bite.Fuck me it was him! I stood there before the man. Turning I looked back to Ajahn Phra TaSol to see that his head was once again bowed in prayer and that neither myself or the husband were no longer a part of his consideration. 	Then I felt the burst of energy as the husbands arms suddenly sprang out from his body and in one stabbing notion he thrusted a small knife he’d been concealing in his hands into my chest. Once, then twice. I stepped back feeling the searing pain of the knife wound as blood spurted out onto the white tiled floor. The husband, springing to his feet as I reeled in shock. The man’s bare feet slipping to the floor in the bloody mess he’d himself just created.       Stepping forward with one hand held against my chest I reached out grabbing the man by his robe and pulled him up to me. The husband spinning in the robe as he went. Then with another thrust the man stabbed me again as he slashed out with the knife catching me in my free arm. And then like a rat desperately heading for the freedom of an open door, he ran. The man’s naked wet feet slipping beneath him as he did. Sending him one way into the shocked congregation and the other into the line of monks he was pretending to be part of. 	Stepping away from my own blood that now lay before me, I gave chase. One hand holding tight to the wounds I felt in my chest. The other swinging whilst it bled as I careered after him towards the door. Then just as he reached the temples entrance, I caught up again with the man. Grabbing his orange robe as it trailed behind floating in the air. It’s natural wrap causing him to spin as I pulled it tight, twisting his body and legs and upsetting the rhythm of his feet as he ran. The man stumbling through the door as his misplaced steps hit the sea of shoes sending him tumbling head over heels onto the temples steps. And there he fell in his long flowing orange robe, bouncing and spinning, colliding hard each time with the ancient concrete steps, until he lay still in the dark gravel on the road below. 	I stood at the top of the stairs looking down at the man’s body as it lay motionless on the ground. Then I saw the door to our noisy Honda open. Still holding my chest, I began to walk down the steps. Feeling the pain in my wounds and careful with my footing as I went. I reached the bottom as Steve arrived at the same time. My brother looking to the monk as he lay there. The man lying dead. His face and body cut open from the fall. Steve looking then to me and seeing the blood under my hands, saying,	“Jesus Christ! What the fuck have you done now? You threw him down the fucking stairs!”	“I didn’t do anything.” I answered for once in complete honesty as I reached down with my free hand and pulled the orange satchel from the husbands side. Holding it at my waist I lifted the large canvas flap and looked inside to see a bottle of water, a Buddhist bible and bundles of tightly bound one thousand baht notes. Looking to Steve I then said. 	“here’s your money, so now you don’t owe anything.” And with that, I turned and with the satchel on my shoulder began the long hard walk up the temple steps.       I reached the top. The crowd that had gathered now standing on the scattered shoes parting for me as we met. Stepping back in side and holding my chest, I then saw Sherri. The girl standing to the side with a group of relatives with her mouth open just staring. Her eyes catching mine. Showing the fleeting recognition only the two of us could comprehend. Then I reached Ajahn Phra TaSol, the man still sitting on his chair at peace with his body curled and his head lowered. Then as he raised his back and lifted his head, he stared at me once again though sunken watery eyes. Holding the satchel, tainted now with traces of my own blood to him, I said. 	“This belongs to you.”And as his eyes for a moment brightened and shone, he replied, simply saying. Thank you.And it was a thank you which came without words but instead with the look he gave. As his eyes for that moment held mine in a connection of understanding. And in that moment I knew that we both had in some spiritual way become joined. Both knowing that a certain evil had been removed from this world. 					****************      There was not much else I remembered about that particular night. The blood that was leaking from my system onto the temples floor, causing me to black out. Only for me to wake the next day in a brightly lit room with a drip in my arm. Steve sitting close by on a vinyl chair saying as soon as he saw my eyes open.	“You should see the chick who’s been in here playing about with that pipe they stuck in your dick.” Myself saying back as I looked under the sheets to see he wasn’t lying. I then looked around the room. 	“Where’s the puppy.”	“With that housing association guy who keeps talking about kicking your ass.”	“He okay?” I asked, suddenly worried the man may be contemplating some sort of revenge via my dog.	“Yeah, he’s good, the man’s scared of you. I think he heard you threw that guy down them steps.”	“I didn’t.” I said as I felt the pain in my chest begin to return. 	“Not what I saw from the car? Anyway the guy deserved it. He was a bit of a prick I think.”A bit? Then keeping at me, Steve said. 	“Your girl came here this morning. Told me it would never have worked between us because she had issues.”	“Lucky ones died early eh?” I said, and at the same time after all the chats we’d had about our father, I knew, I had again, just put my foot in my mouth. Ignoring me, Steve carried on saying,	“She said you killed her husband as well. No police though, none of that shit. Those guys at the temple just threw the prick in the burner with mumsy. Job done. Two for one special on shitheads going at the temple on Wednesdays maybe?”	“Maybe.” I answered as I thought about that guy lying dead in the burner next to his mother. I then felt the bandages on my chest and both arms. Steve carrying on saying,	“She said, they threw money in the air at the end to make all the local children happy as the bodies were burning up, said it’s a thing here.”How ironic,  	“Seems like the guy did a better job on you than those dogs I think?” Steve carried on saying, then followed it up with a question that I knew was burning from within. 	“So what’s the deal, everywhere you go, you lashing out and shit and people seem to die? You know you keep saying it wasn’t me, it wasn’t me, I didn’t do it. Playing innocent and shit. But you could at least just confess to just one.” And deep down I knew exactly where this was going and I’m sure it was never going to end. So this time I just told him straight what he wanted to here. And for once in my life it was the truth.	“Yeah, I killed somebody once, I’ll admit that” I said “I killed dad.” And I had, that for sure was the truth. But I had not killed him with my hands, I killed him with my words.					      ***************       And that’s what had happened when that strange man had arrived at our door and turned our lives upside down. All us together as a family having Sunday lunch, which sadly turned out to our last. This little yellow car pulling up outside. My father seeing it first. This composed, cool headed man for once showing weakness. This little man, in his see through lace outfit with red vest and undies, getting out and strutting down our garden path with tears in his eyes. The man banging on the door with his forehead pushed tight against the stained glass window. Screaming out, “I love you - I love you,” into the doors wooden frame and through the letter box. My father sitting there red in the face in utter panic. The man shouting “don’t leave me, please don’t leave me!” over and over as he stepped into the garden. Steve and I motionless at the table with our mouths open. Looking accusatory to our mother for an answer. Then feeling the questionable sensation work its way through both of us, as the realization of truth set in straight after this man called out our fathers name.  	Our father sitting there, doing nothing. This mountain of a man, sedentary with his head lowered in shame. Our mother not saying a word. And then as the quick as it had all started, this distraught man. Overwhelmed by desperation and possessed by a sudden incontrollable moment of madness, had burnt himself out. And off he went in his crazy twinky gay clothes. Back down the garden path, back into his little yellow car, and was then gone. Back into the world that he came from.	For a moment we all just sat there. Steve and I for once silent. Both of us brothers looking to each other as silent tears ran from our mothers eyes and our father looked to his plate of half eaten food. 	And then unable to keep it in I simply asked.	“Who the fuck was that dad?”My father staying still whilst our mother left the table and disappeared to their marital bedroom. I asked again,      “What the fuck dad, who was that guy?”My father saying nothing, just sitting. Steve looking to me, shaking his head slightly letting me know I should let it go. But I could not. 	“What’s going on dad?” I asked again, and asked again and again, and again.	“Explain yourself.” I said once more as my father then slowly stood and without looking to either of us or saying a word. Myself on and on at him, calling him a loser, fag, and a cunt over and over, as he walked to his study and locked the door. And there he sat in for what seemed an age. Until that solitary shot rang out. That one shot which destroyed our fathers life and everyone else around him who loved him so dear. One shot. Triggered by words that came from me. Vicious and angry words that flowed from my mouth irrepressibly, with venomous wrath, in a manner which I could not control then and still to this day ever since.       Telling the man right there and then the truth of how I felt. When in reality I could not have been more wrong. One single shot, which echoed through our beloved home, bouncing from the ceilings and walls of the rooms were we’d all played as children and as men. One solitary shot, loaded to the hilt with guilt and shamed regret that broke the poisonous and anxious atmosphere of silence that had so suddenly become our world, like a bullet to the roof of one great mans mouth. Of which it was.					***************	Steve sat there looking to me as I stared at the white hospital wall in front of him which needed a painting of some sort. Then he said.	“You think that was on you what he did?”I did. That was something I could not deny.	      “That wasn’t you Sandy” Steve said, “It wasn’t you.” 	“You think mum didn’t have her secrets? You think she was innocent? Dad had his own life. What he did with it was his business. You can’t hate him or yourself for what happened. For what he did. You can’t spend the rest of your life lashing out with your words and actions. I’ve seen the change in you since. The old Sandy would never have thrown a monk down some temple stairs. The brother I had would never have drowned some yappy dog. You just need to let it go. Forgive him. I have. I’m sad yes, sometimes unimaginably so. As we both know. But I have forgiven.”	I sat there and listened to this kid. This brother of mine who wasn’t wrong. This kid who maybe wasn’t so stupid after all. This kid who never seemed capable of saying one sensible and comprehendible word. But now just had. 					***************      A week later I was out and sitting back on the beach in Pattaya. This time with my boots off and my feet in the warm water of the gulf of Thailand. The palms swaying above me in the breeze. The sun on my back and a amulet sitting around my neck.       May calling three times a day seeing how I was, and asking if she could visit. Sherri doing just that without asking for permission. The girl turning up, wearing her high heels on the beach. Myself caught in a love triangle and needing to pick a winner. Knowing deep down that with the shallow, oil rigger, raised by wolves mentality I possessed, the victor, in the end would inevitably come down to breast size. 	Sherri now with me and the little fella. Hanging out on the sand. Whilst Steve now hung out of which ever young lady he could find on the clean-up crew he’d joined at the same beach I’d first found the little fella. The man now, I was told, keeping away from ladyboys so as not to get into any fights.       Sherri free from manipulative abuse that came from the forced marriage she had endured. Happy in the fact she’d sort the help of a one hundred and seven year old monk who’s only wish was to now pass into his next life. But somehow wasn’t being allowed. The girl now adamant in her mind that it had been him who had spiritually orchestrated the downfall of her newly departed husband and the wretched network he belonged too.      And as I sat there with this girl on my arm and my dog at my feet. I saw him. This man in the distance, walking towards me. This guy this slick dressed detective from the tourist police. The same man who’d travelled all the way down south from Pattaya to the police station not more than a month before. The man stealing my car once he’d arrived. Letting me know as he did how the man I’d thrown from a window back in Pattaya had sold children. And that the man who bought those children had done so with the money he’d stolen from me.       This detective from the tourist police named Soone Junmuang, wearing an amulet not to dissimilar to the one I now wore with pride as he spoke. The man letting me know a task had been bestowed upon him by an olden monk. The man back then whilst I’d sat in that interrogation room the day I’d first met him, asking if I was truly here to help, or was I just going to sit with my feet on the beach like every other  – Loser? The End :      							 	  2
